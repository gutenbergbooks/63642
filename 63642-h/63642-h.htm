  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“<i>Dear little daughter</i>,” ran the telegram, “<i>when
you get this, fill a suit-case with a few things that
you’ll need most, and leave with Daddy for Grandma’s.—Mother.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The train was already moving. Phœbe, with all
the solemnity of her fourteen years, puckered her
brows over the slip of yellow paper, winked her
long lashes at it reflectively, and pursed a troubled
mouth. How strange that dear Mother should
leave the New York apartment in mid-morning,
with the usual gay kiss that meant short separation;
and then in that same hour should send this
message—this command—which was to start
Phœbe away from the great city, where all of her
short life had been spent, toward that smaller city
where lived the Grandmother she had never seen,
and the two Uncles—one a Judge and the other a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>clergyman—who, though her father’s own brothers,
were yet strangers to their only niece!</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow, without having to be told, Phœbe had
always understood that Mother did not like Grandma,
or the Uncles, judicial and ecclesiastic. Then
why was Mother, without a real farewell, and
without motherly preparation in the matter of
dress, and with no explanations, sending Phœbe to
those paternal relations?</p>

<p class='c008'>It was all very strange! It was mysterious, like—yes,
like stories Phœbe had seen in moving-pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>Out of the gloom and clangor of the great station,
the train was now fast winding its way, past
lights that burned, Phœbe thought, like those in the
big basement of the apartment house where she
had lived so long. Now the coach was leaving one
pair of rails for a new pair—changing direction
with a sharp clicking of the wheels and a heavy
swaying of the huge car’s body. And now the line
of coaches was straightening itself to take, as Phœbe
knew, that long plunge under the southward flowing
Hudson.</p>

<p class='c008'>She let the telegram fall to her lap and closed
her eyes, with a drawing in of the breath. She was
picturing all that lay above the roof of the car and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the larger domed roof of the tunnel—first there
was the river-bed, which the domed roof upheld;
next, the wide, deep reach of water which, in turn,
held up the ferries and any other passing ships;
last of all, the sky, cloud-flecked and sun-lit, through
which winged the birds. What a load for that narrow,
domed roof!</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father had been busy with the luggage, directing
the porter about the disposal of the two suitcases
while taking off his own overcoat and hat.
But as he glanced down at Phœbe, he misunderstood
the lowering of telegram and eyelids, and
dropped quickly to a place beside her. His hand
closed over hers, lovingly, and with a pressure that
showed concern. “Phœbe?” he questioned tenderly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She opened her eyes with a sudden reassuring
smile. Though in the last three or four years her
father had been absent from home long months
at a time, so that during any year she might see
him only seldom, and then for brief afternoons
only, her affection for him was deep, and scarcely
second to her love for her mother. Each visit of
his was marked by gifts as well as by a holiday outing—to
the Park, the Zoo, or some moving-picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>theatre; so that gratitude and pleasure mingled with
her happiness at seeing him. Also, his visits had,
for her, the novelty and joy of the unexpected. He
came from Somewhere—mysteriously; and went
again, into an Unknown that Phœbe made a part
of her day-dreams.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so her love for him was tinged with something
of the romantic. She was proud of him, and
she thought him handsome. Her mother never
exclaimed over him, but other people did. “Was
that your father I saw you with yesterday?” they
would ask; and when Phœbe said Yes, they would
add, “Oh, but <i>isn’t</i> he good-looking!” All of which
delighted Phœbe, who long since had compared him
with the heroes she had seen pictured on the screen—which
comparison was to the very great disadvantage
of the film favorites. Her father was to
her so gallant a figure that she often wondered at
her mother’s indifference to him. But then mother
herself was so lovely!</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe Blair was like her father. Her eyes
were gray-blue, and set so far apart on either side
of her nose that the upper half of her face, at
first glance, had the appearance of being, if anything,
a trifle too wide—which made her firm little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>chin seem, correspondingly, a trifle too peaked.
Her hair was light brown, thick to massiness, but
straight save where it blew against the clear pink
of her cheeks in slightly curling tendrils. Of her
features, it was her mouth that challenged her
eyes in beauty—a fine, sweet mouth that registered
every mood of those grave and womanly eyes. As
for her height, it was a matter of the greatest
pride to her that she already reached to her father’s
shoulder. But she was, despite her height, still
the little girl—sailor hat on bobbed hair, serge
jacket worn over blue linen dress, slim, brown-stockinged
legs, and laced brown shoes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father was thirty-seven. It seemed an almost
appalling age to his small daughter. And yet
he still had a boyish slenderness. He was tall, and
straight, with a carriage that was noticeably military—acquired
at the preparatory school to which
his elder brothers had sent him. His hair, brown
and thick like his daughter’s, was just beginning to
show a sprinkling of gray at the temples. His eyes
were Phœbe’s eyes—set wide apart, given to straight
looking, and quick, friendly smiles. He had presented
her with his straight nose, too, and his mouth.
But his chin was firmer than hers, a man’s chin, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>the chin of a man who, once having set forward
on any course, does not turn back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe thought him quite perfect. And she
thought it wonderful that he should be a mining-engineer.
“It’s a clean business,” he had told her
once, when she was about ten years of age. “It
takes a man into the big out-doors.” She had
treasured up what he had said—turned it over in
her mind again and again. And had come to feel
that her father was entirely different from the men
whom she met in her home—a man set wholly
apart.</p>

<p class='c008'>His profession explained to her his long absences
from New York, and the fact that, in the
last year or so, he had been compelled to make
a club his headquarters during the period of his
short stays in the city. “This place is so tiny,”
Phœbe’s mother always said. “And all Daddy’s
traps are at the Club.” It had never occurred to
Phœbe to doubt anything that Mother told her.
And did not her father fully corroborate this excuse
of Mother’s? Phœbe longed to have her father
stay at home when he arrived in town. But she
never complained against his being away. Hers
was a patient, a trusting, a sturdy little soul.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>With her smile of reassurance, Phœbe had leaned
toward her father, to speak confidingly. “You
know, Daddy,” she began, “it seems so funny that
Mother had me go the way she did. Don’t you
think so?—without saying why she wanted me to
leave, or—or anything? Did she say anything
about it to you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, you see,” her father answered, “having
you go this way spared your dear little heart. No
good-byes, or tears. But pretty soon Grandma’s,
with Uncle Bob, and Uncle John, and a big garden,
and a horse——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A horse!” marveled Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s an old horse, and he pulls the surrey.
Because Uncle Bob won’t have a motor car—he
wants to walk to and from the Court House, and
keep down his weight, and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Bob is fat?” Phœbe inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, stout. And Uncle John, being a clergyman,
and a trifle particular, doesn’t believe ministers
should rush around in automobiles. So the
surrey is for Uncle John, but Grandma will let you
drive for her sometimes. And there are ducks and
chickens to feed, and big beds of flowers, and a tall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>green hedge where the birds build their nests,
and——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And when will Mother come?” interposed
Phœbe, with an intonation which made plain her
opinion that it would certainly take mother to
make the suburban picture complete.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” said her father, speaking with a new
earnestness, “Mother is not very well, and she is
planning to leave New York for a while, and go
where she can get better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know she isn’t very well,” agreed Phœbe.
“She coughs too much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exactly. You know, Mother’s health hasn’t
been good for quite a while——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And she must have the change. I didn’t want
to have you go, dear, to a strange city, where your
mother has no friends, and might be very ill. So
away you go to Grandma’s till everything is
straightened out. And you’ll—— Oh, look at that
automobile!—there! It’s keeping up with the
train! My! My! but that’s considerable speeding!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They talked of other things then,—of the homes
past which they were rushing, the towns through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>which they glided and grandly ignored, except for
a gingerly slowing down. Noon came, and with it
a visit to the dining-car. Then the afternoon
dragged itself along. Toward the latter half of it,
Phœbe, worn by the excitement of the sudden departure,
and lulled by the motion of the train,
curled up on the green plush of the car seat and
fell asleep, her short brown hair spread fanwise
upon her father’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>The afternoon went; twilight came. Still the
train rushed on, carrying Phœbe northward toward
that new home awaiting her. She slept a second
time, after a simple supper. Her journey was to
end shortly before midnight. For this reason her
father judged it best that a berth should not be
made up for her, but that she should rest as she had
in the afternoon, her head on his breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>She smiled as she slept, blissfully unaware that all
at once her happy life was changing; that she was
being uprooted like some plant; that a tragedy
of which she was as yet mercifully ignorant had
come forward upon her, wave-like and overwhelming,
to sweep her forever from her course!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A rain was drenching the blackness of the night
as the New York train reached the small city that
was Phœbe’s destination. Her father had wakened
her a little in advance of their stop, and when
she had washed her face and smoothed her hair, she
had peered through the double glass of a car window
a-stream with water—and then recoiled from
the panes with a sinking of the heart. How dark
it was out there! how stormy! how lightless after
a life-time in a city which, no matter at what hour
she might awake, was always alight!</p>

<p class='c008'>A long whistle made her catch up her hat and
adjust its elastic under her chin. The porter had
already taken her father’s suit-case and her own to
the forward end of the coach. With a wild thumping
in her breast and a choking in her throat, she
followed her father to the vestibule, where the porter
waited with the suit-case and a small, square
stool upon which, presently, she stepped down to
meet the rain.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>There was a single light in the station, and beside
it leaned a young man in an agent’s cap. With
her hand on her father’s arm—for he was carrying
both of the cases—she crossed a double line
of glistening rails to the depot, not taking her
eyes from the agent, who represented to her, at
the moment, the sole sign of life and refuge in that
black, roaring downfall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, “Jim!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hello, Bob!” Her father dropped the luggage
and stretched both hands out to a figure that had
emerged, in a shining raincoat, from the blackness.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And Phœbe!” exclaimed Uncle Bob, lifting
Phœbe from her feet and at the same time turning
himself about, so that she was carried forward to
the shelter of a roof. “God bless her! We’ll jump
into the surrey, Jim, and I’ll have you home in a
jiffy. What a ghastly night!—It’ll take the snow
off, Phœbe. But we’ll have more. And then for
some sleigh-rides!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The train was gone, booming into the distance,
with parting shrieks that grew fainter and fainter.
As Phœbe was helped to the rear seat of the surrey,
Uncle Bob holding aside the curtains that shut
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>out the storm, she turned her head to look through
the night to where great sparks were going up with
the smoke of the engine. The train was leaving
her—that train which seemed her only link with
New York, with the beloved apartment that was to
her the home-nest, with her mother—her dear,
beautiful mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe gulped.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the front seat sounded her uncle’s voice—a
nice voice, she concluded, though not at all like
Daddy’s. As if he understood something of what
she was feeling—the lostness, the loneliness, the
sensation of being torn up and thrust out—her
father had taken his seat beside her and put an
arm about her, drawing her so closely to him that,
for comfort, she was forced to take off her hat.
The surrey was moving. And its two side-lamps
were casting a rain-blurred light upon the flanks
of a bay horse. Phœbe peered forward at the
horse. She had pictured him after horses she had
seen in Central Park—shiny-coated saddlers, or
carriage pairs, proud and plump and high-stepping,
with docked tails and arching necks. But this horse
was almost thin, and moved slowly, with a <i>plop-plop-plop</i>
through the miry puddles of the unpaved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>street. This horse had a long tail, and his head
was on a level with his back. Phœbe was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drive took some time. Yet conversation
lagged, and was a one-sided affair between Uncle
Bob and the horse, in which the former urged the
latter to “Get up” and “Go ’long.” Here and there
a street light shone with a sickly yellow flame
through the pelting drops. Phœbe tried to see
something of the town, to right and left over Uncle
Bob’s wide shoulders. But only the dim outlines
of buildings were discernible. Strange and stormy
was the little she could see. And there rose in her
a feeling against this town into which she was
come; so that, with Grandma and Uncle John still
to meet and know, she yet longed for a quick turnabout,
and a train that would carry her away again—away
and away to the great city, to her little bed
and her pretty mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>The surrey drew up beside a large house that
showed a dozen glowing windows, and as the wheels
scraped the boards of a step, voices called out in
greeting, and Uncle Bob answered them. “I’ve
got ’em!” he cried. Whereupon a hand pulled at
the curtain of the surrey on Phœbe’s side, and here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>under an umbrella, was a tall, thin gentleman in
black, who wore eye-glasses and had large teeth.
“Our dear little niece!” he exclaimed. And Phœbe
climbed down to him, steadying herself by his hand,
and was led by him to a wide door where Grandma
was waiting—a slender little lady in a gray dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe permitted herself to be kissed, first by
Grandma, then by Uncle John, as the man with
large teeth proved to be, then by Uncle Bob, who
had shed his raincoat and now stood forth, a
heavy-set person, quite bald, and apple-cheeked,
with smiling blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greetings over, Phœbe fell back a step, felt
for and found her father’s hand, and then lost herself
in contemplation of the trio of new relatives.
Of them, Daddy had, assuredly, spoken frequently.
But, man-like, he had never essayed a description
of them, never endowed them either with virtues or
faults, never taught her in advance to render to the
three any love or loyalty. So that now, appraising
them, Phœbe was unprejudiced in her judgment,
and viewed them as she might have viewed
three strangers who were not related. How very
old Grandma was! Phœbe noted that the white
head trembled steadily, as if Grandma were, perhaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>cold. As for Uncle John, there was something
altogether forbidding about him—eye-glasses,
teeth and all. Aloofness was a part of her feeling
toward this clerical uncle. But Uncle Bob—upon
his apple-round cheeks glistened drops that Phœbe
knew were not rain. And his eyes were shining
with something that Phœbe recognized—the something
she knew as love. He was big, he was round,
he was, oh, so very homely. But straightway, with
a child’s true instinct, Phœbe loved him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Behind the three was another figure. Phœbe
first glimpsed the white apron, which to her city-bred
eyes meant that here was a maid. And such
a funny maid, in a lavender dress, with no cap on
tousled yellowish hair that had been kinked rather
than curled. The maid had a wide, grinning mouth,
and eager, curious, hazel eyes. Yet altogether she
was a likeable person, Phœbe decided. Youth spoke
to youth across the Blair sitting-room. So that
when all were seated in the high-ceilinged dining-room
for a bite of supper, Phœbe answered Sophie’s
smile with one of her own, and for the cup of
steaming chocolate that was set at her plate murmured
a friendly “Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The supper was a quiet affair. Grandma bobbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>and nodded over her chocolate, speaking only when
Sophie was to fetch something or when one of the
three men needed to be urged to another helping.
Uncle John spoke not at all—after he had said
what Phœbe afterwards learned was “a blessing”.
He looked at his food crossly. Phœbe’s father had
little to say, too. He looked tired and white. And
when he smiled at Phœbe, he seemed not to see her,
but to be looking beyond somehow. Only Uncle
Bob appeared cheerful. His eyes danced when
Phœbe lifted her eyes to him shyly. Every now
and then he patted her shoulder. But—compared
by her New York standards—Phœbe voted the supper
altogether dreary—the result, she felt sure, of
having Uncle John present.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little later, she was conducted to her room by
Sophie. How unlike was that strange bed-chamber
to the wee, cosy place, all rose hangings and sheer
white, which for as long as her memory could
trace had held her white bed and the twin one
that was her mother’s! The new room was at the
top of a long, wide stairway that wound back upon
itself. The new room was high, and surely as
large, Phœbe thought, as all of the New York apartment
made into one. It had lace curtains at both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>windows, and there was an old-style dressing-table,
slabbed over its top with mottled marble. When
Phœbe touched the marble, she drew back from it,
and stared, a little amazed. It was so cold!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie seemed to guess something of what was
passing through Phœbe’s mind. “I’ll just put a
fancy towel on it t’morra,” she promised. “Ain’t
had time today.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” murmured Phœbe. Certainly the
dressing-table needed something.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie hung about for a little, shifting her
weight from one substantial foot to the other, and
making offers of aid. Could she unpack Phœbe’s
jo-dandy suit-case? Phœbe replied with a polite,
“No, thank you.” Could she unbutton the blue linen
dress? (“My, it’s pretty!”) Again, “No, thank
you.” Then the windows had to be raised a trifle,
and lowered again because of the rain. There were
two windows, great, high affairs against which tall
green blinds were fastened. Next, Sophie displayed
the clothes-closet, and hung Phœbe’s serge
coat on a nail. Last of all, she caught up the two
thick pillows on the wide bed, beat them as a baker
beats his dough (and with a touch of something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>almost like temper), flung them down into place
once more, and grudgingly sidled to the door.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe, standing in the middle of the floor, hat
still in hand, made a pathetic little figure that appealed
to Sophie’s heart. “Ain’t there anything I
can do?” she inquired, persisting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe nodded. “If—if Daddy will please come
up to kiss me good-night,” she answered, choking;
“and—and put out my light.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll tell him, you betcha,” declared Sophie, heartily.
She went out, turning her tousled head to smile
a good-night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe hurried with her undressing. There was
no running water in the big room, and she could
not bring herself to open her door and call down,
or go down, in quest of it. Presently, however,
she caught sight of a tall pitcher standing in a wide,
flowered bowl, both atop what seemed to be a cupboard.
She went to peer into the pitcher. Sure
enough! The pitcher was full of water; and Phœbe,
using all the strength of her slender arms, heaved
it up and out and filled the bowl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How funny!” she marveled. And once in bed,
with a single electric light shining full into her
face from where it hung on a cord from the high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>center of the ceiling, she studied the room itself,
walls, furniture, curtains, carpet. “How queer!”
she murmured, over and over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, big eyes!” hailed her father, when he came
in.</p>

<p class='c008'>She raised on an elbow. “Daddy,” she whispered,
“isn’t it so—so different here—everything.
Why, in New York nobody has water-pitchers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father laughed. “This is a wonderful old
house,” he declared. He sat down beside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s so big!” Phœbe lay back. Her hand crept
into her father’s and she looked up at the high ceiling,
with its covering of wall-paper in a wavy, watered
design.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll get used to it,” he promised, “and you’ll
like it. And do you know how happy Grandma
is to have you?—Uncle John and Uncle Bob, too?
I can see they love my little girl already.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And they’ll love Mother,” added Phœbe, stoutly
“You just wait till she comes back well again.
Won’t they, Daddy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father rose, and the smile in his eyes gave
place to an expression of sudden pain. “I don’t
doubt it,” he answered hastily. Then leaning to
smooth back the hair from her brow, “You’re tired,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>aren’t you, darling? And so is Daddy. We’ll
say good-night now, and in the morning there’ll be
so much to see, and do, and talk about.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He laid his cheek against hers, so babyish still.
“God bless my daughter,” he said tenderly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her arms went round his neck then. “Oh,
Daddy,” she implored brokenly, “how long will I
be away from mother? Oh, Daddy, just one day
and I miss her so!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He soothed her. “I can’t tell, Phœbe,” he asserted.
“But will you trust me to do the best that
I know how?”</p>

<p class='c008'>With her wide eyes upon him, he stood at the
middle of the room, his right arm raised to put
out the electric light. He pulled at the cord, and
the room went dark. He felt his way to the door
then, and went out with a last affectionate good-night
which Phœbe answered cheerily enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the sound of his footsteps died away in
the hall, she stared into the blackness, seeing him
still there at the room’s center with his arm upraised.
And her loneliness and loss she told silently
to that picture of her father which still remained
under the swinging globe in the blackness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“I want Mother,” she said, over and over. “Oh,
Daddy, I want to go back to New York, to Mother.
Oh, Daddy, don’t leave me here without Mother.”
Then, “Oh, Mother, if I could only be with you!
Oh, dear, dear Mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The tears came then,—tears of weariness as well
as grief. And Phœbe, curled up in the wide bed, her
face buried in the curve of an arm, sobbed herself
to sleep.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A fairy bell was tinkling. The clear tones were
part of a dream so sweet, though afterwards not
remembered, that Phœbe smiled in her sleep. The
tinkling grew steadily louder. Phœbe waked, saw
where she was, and raised her head to listen. The
bell was outside. Persistent and musical, its ringing
called Phœbe from her bed to a window. She
peered down through a gap in the storm shutters.</p>

<p class='c008'>A messenger boy on a bicycle was coming up the
curving drive that led from the front gate to the
house. The rain was over. The sun glinted on the
metal of his wheel. He disappeared from Phœbe’s
view under a square, flat roof that was one story
below her window.</p>

<p class='c008'>She ran to put on her shoes and stockings. She
splashed her face with the icy water in the flowered
bowl, and dressed at top speed. A messenger boy
conveyed only one thing to her: a telegram from
her mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was right. When she came racing down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to ask, her father was standing by the front door
in the big hall, the telegram open in his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not permit Phœbe to read the wire, but
put it away in the leather case that held his paper
money. And he did not reply to it by another telegram
when the messenger boy reminded him that
there was an answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll write your mother,” he explained to Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>After breakfast he sat down to write. That first
day at Grandma’s, Phœbe learned that during each
week-day morning the library was sacred to Uncle
John. So Phœbe’s father wrote at Grandma’s desk
in the sitting-room, with Phœbe writing at the sewing-table
close by.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father’s letter was short. His face was
stern as he wrote it. Then he paced the floor.
Phœbe had often seen him like that in New York.
She understood that he was frequently worried over
business. And she understood business worries,
because she had seen several worried business men
in the “movies.” Usually they stood over curious
machines out of which ran a long narrow strip
of paper. And as a rule they ended by committing
suicide with a pistol. Phœbe stole anxious
glances toward her father as she wrote.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“<i>Darling, darling Mother</i>,” ran her letter, “<i>I did
as you said. But I hope you’re going to tell me to
come home right away. It’s nice here, only I want
you, and I hope I’ll be back before Saturday. Your
loving daughter, Phœbe.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a short letter, since it occurred to Phœbe
that perhaps a little of her father’s pacing might
be due to impatience. She was not a rapid penman.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her letter finished and folded, she took it to him.
“Put this in with yours, Daddy?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stared down at her, not answering for a moment.
Then, “Yes,” he said, “of course.” He
added her letter to his, but he did not seal the envelope.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he was gone, Phœbe sat down to wait.
There were things to be seen outside—a barn to
explore, and a chicken-coop. Also, Grandma had
promised to show Phœbe over the house. But
Phœbe was not especially interested. What she
wanted most was the return of her father, that she
might hear the hour of her return to New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie came in to set the living-room to rights.
On better acquaintance, there was something exceedingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>attractive about Sophie. Her hair was
so bright, her eyes were roguish. She had dimples.
In the matter of dress, however, she entirely lacked
that black-and-white smartness which Sally, Mother’s
colored maid, possessed. Remembering Sally
gave Phœbe a happy thought: Here was the one,
of all those in the big house, who would be a pleasant
companion to the local “movies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there a moving-picture theatre in this town?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is there!” cried Sophie. “I should say! Many
as nine, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m so glad!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mm.” Sophie looked doubtful, somehow. But
she kept her own counsel. “I seen a grand picture
last night,” she confided.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you! Oh, tell me about it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>First, for some reason, Sophie went to the door
and looked out into the hall. Then, launching into
her story, she dropped her voice. “It was all about
awful rich folks,” she began. “There was a girl,
and you seen her at the start in her papa’s viller.
He’s so rich that his hired men wear knee pants.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The story grew. With it mounted Phœbe’s interest
and Sophie’s enthusiasm. And when Sophie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>was done, Phœbe in turn remembered a picture full
of high adventure and love that put danger to
scorn.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The horse jumped off a fast train,” she related.
“And the brave young cow-boy fell to the water
below. But horses can swim. This horse made for
shore, and the cow-boy swam along beside him.
The waves were high—it must have been the ocean.
Now you saw him, now you didn’t. But he got
closer and closer to land. Pretty soon the horse
touched bottom. You saw the cow-boy was safe.
When there, on the beach, stood the villain—with
a gun in his hands!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe.” Her father had entered. He was
frowning at Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy!” Phœbe ran to him. “Oh, there are
nine movie theatres in this town, Sophie says. Oh
Daddy, I’d like to go to one this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, Uncle John, Phœbe,” said her father.</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not understand. “Couldn’t Sophie take
me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe, your Uncle John is a clergyman,” explained
her father, his voice grave. “If his niece
goes to the movies, that looks as if he approves of
them. And he doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Phœbe stared, aghast. “But Mother took me
hundreds of times,” she reminded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not in this town, dear.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But can’t I even see travel pictures?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe sat down, dumbfounded. Sophie went
out quietly, without lifting those roguish eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe’s father came over to his daughter, and
rested a gentle hand on her shoulder. “In this
house,” he said, speaking very low, “the less my
little girl says about the movies the better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, sir,” answered Phœbe, dutifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>But rebellion came into her heart that first morning.
And thereafter her Uncle John, rector of
the town’s most exclusive church, and undeniably
a most devout man, was to play the rôle of villain
in the drama which Phœbe felt that she was living.</p>

<p class='c008'>The subject of moving-pictures was forgotten
temporarily when more fairy tinklings announced
the arrival, about noon, of a second messenger boy.
He had still another telegram from Phœbe’s mother.
And this time he waited while Phœbe’s father wrote
out an answer. Then he went tinkling away.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is Mother anxious about us, Daddy?” Phœbe
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Yes, darling. But we’re all right here, aren’t
we?—for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I guess so,” said Phœbe, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c008'>A third telegram came later on in the day, and
a fourth that evening. The day following brought
others. More arrived the day after that. Phœbe’s
father answered some of them in kind, others by
letter. After the arrival of the first one he had
taken on something of a resigned, almost cheerful,
air, and had explained each message to Phœbe, declaring
laughingly that her mother would burn up
the telegraph wires; while Phœbe, with her numerous
letters, would put a terrible strain on the local
post-office.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet for all his gaiety, Phœbe sensed that there
was something about it all which she did not understand.
For one thing, why did her mother not
write to her?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has Mother written you?” she asked her father.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.” But though he searched his pockets and
the desk, he failed to locate the letter. Also he
was not able to remember much that the letter contained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course,” conceded Phœbe, “Mother isn’t
a very good letter-writer. Whenever you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>away, she’d say, ‘You write to Daddy.’ And I
would. Darling Mother! She never liked to sit
down and go at it. She just seems to hate ink.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s why she wires,” declared Phœbe’s father.
“It’s easy to get off a telegram.—Oh, well.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe kept on puzzling over it all. When
the telegrams stopped, her father admitted that letters
kept on arriving. But he never showed any
of them to Phœbe, or read to her from them. He
explained that they were about very private matters.
“What?” Phœbe asked herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yes, there was something about all this telegraphing
and letter-writing which she did not understand.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There was something else which Phœbe did not
understand. Walking, mittened and warmly clad,
over the snow-crusted half-acre of Grandma’s garden,
she gave herself up to conjecture. Or in the
sitting-room, with Grandma seated nearby, sewing,
she puzzled her small head. And when she drove
with Uncle Bob into the country, through lanes of
naked trees that edged bare fields, she studied his
big, good-natured face and wished that she might
open her heart and ask him all about it.</p>

<p class='c008'>That something else which she did not understand
was this: a strict watch was being kept upon
her—almost as if in fear!</p>

<p class='c008'>Why? Did they, her father, and her uncles and
grandmother, think that, missing her mother, she
might run away to New York? Or was it that they
guessed how terribly she longed for her mother,
and made sure that she should never be left alone?
But—if they were sparing her loneliness, why was
she not sent to school every day, like other children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>whom she saw clattering along the sidewalk
that ran just outside the high hedge? Or why
were children not asked into the big Blair garden
to play with her? And why did Daddy, who for
years had been so busy with his work that he could
seldom give her more than a very occasional afternoon,
why was he putting aside all work now in
order to stay there with her—particularly since
Mother, ill and alone, assuredly needed him if she
could not have Phœbe?</p>

<p class='c008'>There were other curious things. She was never
permitted to go downtown unless her father accompanied
her. She was never allowed to drive alone
with Grandma. She might not go to Sunday school
or church with Uncle John. And at last she was
able to see that a certain iron rule obtained concerning
her movements: she could not play in the
garden unless Uncle Bob or Daddy was home; and
she could not leave Grandma’s to walk or drive
unless her father or an uncle was in the surrey.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was all very puzzling.</p>

<p class='c008'>When people called, Phœbe did not meet them.
Sophie, suddenly grown enthusiastic over some ordinary
household matter, hurried her upstairs, or
down cellar, as the case might be; or took her egg-hunting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to the tall frame chicken-house standing in
the back lot.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the attic received them, Sophie kept a watch
upon the garden from the tiny attic window; and
as soon as the visitors took their leave, Sophie’s
interest in the top of the house promptly melted, and
Phœbe was coaxed away from the fascinating boxes
and barrels that filled the room, and led down to the
sitting-room and Grandma. If on the approach of
callers Sophie found pressing reasons for going
down into the cellar, and taking Phœbe along, the
watch that was set on the attic window was transferred
to the ceiling of the cellar. For Sophie kept
turning her face up at it inquiringly, kept an ear
cocked toward that corner of it which was under
the wide entrance hall. And when a dull thump announced
the shutting of the front door, Sophie
invariably found herself ready and eager to leave
the cellar for other duties higher up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why don’t I ever meet anybody?” Phœbe pondered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her mind dwelt on certain dark, dramatic possibilities.
In New York, how freely had she tasted
of that—to her—most perfect of all joys—the moving-pictures.
She went to some temple of the silent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>play three or four times every week—sometimes
with her mother, but more often with her mother’s
black maid. Oh, the never lessening lure of the
film dramas! The grip of them! The beauty of
their heroines! The masterful, handsome heroes in
them! The villains always foiled! The maidens
consistently saved! Oh, Dustin Farnum! Oh,
lovely, dainty Marguerite Clark! Oh, gun-handling,
stern and adorable William S. Hart!</p>

<p class='c008'>And now, her imagination trained, Phœbe, as she
considered conditions as she saw them, asked herself
if, perhaps, Daddy and the others were not
in fear of enemies! of kidnappers! of Mexican
bandits! And this new hazard soon came to seem
the logical, then the probable, then the true thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>From a cautious attitude, she changed to actual
fear. She began each day with a careful look from
her windows, scanning the grounds, the hedges.
Once in the open, she looked for foot-prints on the
walks leading up to the house. She was always
on the alert. And a new look came into the gray-blue
eyes—a look of anxious questioning.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was bad enough in the daytime. But at night
she suffered, and dreaded the going-down of the
sun. Toward evening she set herself one task: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>lowering of her curtains, but more particularly the
curtains of the sitting-room—against the peering in
of faces! As twilight came, it seemed to her that
the big house gathered into itself more dwellers
than just the half-dozen of which she was one.
They were up in the attic, these strange visitors,
or down in the cellar, or in the closet under the
stairs. In her own room at bedtime, having glanced
under her four-poster, she locked her clothes-closet
against Something which she felt was lurking therein.
While before she fell asleep, or if she waked
in the still hours, she held her breath and listened—listened.
Sometimes there were snappings; sometimes
softer sounds came to her, like the creeping
of stealthy feet. In the blackness, white shapes
sprang up before even her tight-closed eyes—sprang
up, wavered, swelled, melted. She covered her head.
Never was one small hand left free, lest it be taken
by one unknown and clammy!</p>

<p class='c008'>How she longed to find out about it all, to tell
some one all her terrors. Often at night she determined
to go boldly to her father the very next
morning. Just as often the light of the new day
withered her resolution. “If only Mother were
here,” she told herself. It was easy to confide anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>to Mother. But she shrank from opening
her heart to her father. What she wanted to know
he knew, and could tell her if he wanted her to
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she thought of Sophie. Uncle Bob was not
a remote possibility, but Sophie was even more approachable.
Phœbe broached her subject diplomatically.
“I don’t see many people here, do I?” she
inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was so casual that Sophie had no inkling
of what lay beneath the innocent question. “You
don’t lose much, neither,” was the grunted rejoinder.
(Sophie held local society in high disdain.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“I knew lots of ladies and gentlemen in New
York,” Phœbe went on. “Because Mother has so
many friends—beautiful ladies, that wear beautiful
clothes. And gentlemen who are rich, and have
cars, and bring me candy and things.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie was keenly interested. They were in
Phœbe’s own room on this particular occasion
(Phœbe feeling instinctively that she could get better
results on her own territory), and Sophie was
so eager to hear about New York, and the apartment,
and the ladies, and the men, that she sat down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>and asked many questions, only stopping, now and
then, to go to the door to look out.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Phœbe, nothing loath, answered every question—and
more. So that Sophie was given a very
fair and truthful account of life in the metropolitan
apartment—that is, of the life that Phœbe saw
between her early waking and her early bedtime.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the end of this long talk, Sophie was summoned
downstairs by Grandma’s hand-bell, a round,
squat affair, like a school-teacher’s bell, which stood
on a little table at the foot of the stairs. And a
few minutes later, Phœbe, who had trailed down
after the maid, came upon her in the library. Sophie
was standing close to Grandma, and talking very
low; and when Phœbe entered, the two moved
apart, somewhat hastily, and Sophie smiled a conscious
smile, and looked a little guilty, and began
to talk more loudly than was necessary about her
duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>In that moment, Phœbe realized herself cut off
from the one being in that big house of grown-ups
with whom she had been making ready to share
her little confidences. For now it was plain that
Sophie could not be trusted.</p>

<p class='c008'>One thought did not come to Phœbe, namely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>that the strict watch kept upon her had anything
to do with her mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the thought had occurred, whom could she
have asked? From the very first night of her arrival
Phœbe had discovered that Grandma—dear,
gentle Grandma, with her mild old eyes and her
trembling head—did not care to talk to Phœbe
about Mother. Neither did Uncle Bob, who was
always so ready to chatter boyishly about all other
matters that seemed of interest to his niece. As
for Uncle John, she never considered mentioning
Mother to him. For one day she had left Mother’s
photograph on the mantelpiece in the sitting-room,
and coming for it, she had seen Uncle John with
the picture in his hand. When he discovered Phœbe
beside him, he stared down at her, and the look in
his eyes was not good to see. His lips were drawn
back from his shut teeth, too,—as if he were enraged
at the photograph. He almost flung it down,
and went out with no word.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe understood. Mother had never liked
these three who belonged to Daddy. Naturally,
these three did not like Mother. Even for a girl of
fourteen that was simple enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Daddy—Phœbe understood that if she mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>her mother to her father, the smile on his
face, the light in his eyes, went instantly. And
understanding that, she had come to speak seldom to
him of the one whose absence was a constant hurt,
an ache, a burden.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now Sophie might not be taken into her confidence.
For Sophie, voice lowered and tousled
head bobbing close to Grandma’s, had been telling
over all that Phœbe had told to her. Yes, telling it
all over—and what else? For Grandma’s face, as
Phœbe caught sight of it, was pale and stern, and
her eyes were wide open and angry behind the
round panes of her gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thereafter Phœbe drew more and more into herself.
And what she had to confide, she confided
to the big old doll that had come with her from
New York, packed between two middy-blouses in
the suit-case. The big old doll slept with her,
too, in the wide bed. And for added comfort,
Phœbe put the photograph under her pillow of
nights. When the light was out and the covers
over her head, she drew the photograph forth and
laid her cheek upon it. Cool it was, and smooth,
like the open palm of her mother’s hand. And
held close, thus, it gave forth a faint perfume—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>perfume which Mother had used—which brought
Mother near in the dark of the big room—which
brought the tears, too, the wearisome sobbing that
at last, in turn, brought sleep; and sleep brought
dreams—dear dreams of that loved, perfumed presence
that now, at times, seemed scarcely more than
the figure in a dream.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe had left New York just after the Christmas
holidays—holidays packed with joys as they
had never before been packed. For apart from
the usual tree with the usual gifts, there had been
other things—a horseback ride on a horse that belonged
to one of Mother’s men friends; a score
of drives in a wonderful limousine that was all
blue without and a soft sand-color within, and ran
as if shod with velvet, though with the strength,
Mother said, of eighty horses! And there was a
symphony concert, too, in Carnegie Hall, to which
whole flocks of children came, and to which Phœbe
wore her very best of all white dresses; and there
was an afternoon at the Opera, where Mother had
wonderful seats in a box which Phœbe understood
cost a fortune, and Phœbe saw a great curtain lift
to display castles, and forests, soldiers, knights and
princesses. And, of course, there was that supremest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of joys—the “movies.” In the holidays
the “movies” were an everyday delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>How she longed for them!</p>

<p class='c008'>However, in the big house she spoke of them
only to Sophie, and then in undertones. But in
this matter, as in her separation from her mother,
she was not to any degree submissive. Her silence
indicated that she was; but she was merely biding
her time.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was in January that Phœbe came to the big
house. And the something which she did not understand—that
being watched, and passed from
hand to hand, and kept apart from other children,
and out of school—obtained through all the rest of
the first month of the new year, and through February
and into March.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then, one day, a sudden change! A quick, bewildering,
inexplicable, happy change!</p>

<p class='c008'>First of all, to herald it, Uncle John telephoned
a Miss Simpson, who conducted a school for young
ladies, and held a long and animated conversation
with that lady—a conversation in which “my niece”
and “Phœbe” figured frequently. Next, Daddy appeared
with an unclouded face, and sat down at
the cottage-organ in Grandma’s sitting-room and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>played a little, and sang a song or two, Uncle Bob
joining in. Next, wonder of wonders, Phœbe was
sent to the nearest drug-store two blocks away, to
get something for Grandma—and she was allowed
to go by herself!</p>

<p class='c008'>What had happened?</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not find out.</p>

<p class='c008'>This important news, however, she gleaned from
her father: Mother was now in New York no
longer; she had gone West.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t Mother any better, Daddy?” she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We hope she will be,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you have a letter?” Phœbe wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I got the news in a letter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A wave of scarlet swept up Phœbe’s young throat
and bathed the earnest little face. News of Mother—from
Mother! It choked her, it was all so wonderful.
For had not Mother, for a long time, failed
to send any word to her and Daddy?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, a letter?” breathed Phœbe, and there was
sweet entreaty in the young eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father began to thrust his hands into his
pockets, as if searching, just as he had done on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>occasions before. Finding no letter, he slapped
each pocket with the flat of a hand. He had
colored, too. And his forehead was puckered, and
he blinked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t you find it?” breathed Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well!—Thought I had it. Mm! Sorry.
Must’ve laid it down somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not find the letter. But Phœbe was comforted
by knowing it had come. Mother was West,
in a city built high above the sea. There she would
improve—speedily. So the best thing to do was to
wait patiently. And while she waited—go to
school!</p>

<p class='c008'>The school was Miss Simpson’s. It was not a
school, really, as Phœbe discovered the first day.
It was a house—a house very like Grandma’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of course there were differences. At Miss Simpson’s,
for instance, the cellar held a great iron
monster-thing with which Phœbe felt on friendly
terms. This monster was the boiler, which sent
steam-heat to all the various rooms.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no boiler in Grandma’s cellar, which
was broad and high, brick-floored, and walled with
cobble-stones. It contained, of course, a coal-bin.
And there were other bins that Miss Simpson’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>cellar could not boast—bins for potatoes, and turnips.
And Miss Simpson had no shelves full of
pickles and preserves, and shining cans of lard,
no beams from which hung corn and onions and
peppers, and hams in their sacking, and smoked
bacon in a wrapping of paraffine-paper. She had
no pumpkins piled yellowly in one corner, with
green cabbages close beside. And where were her
pork barrels ranged in a row, topped by tubs holding
the eggs that had been “put down,” and the
winter supply of butter?</p>

<p class='c008'>But Miss Simpson’s cellar was much nicer than
Grandma’s. For it was just like a New York basement!</p>

<p class='c008'>Elsewhere, too, Phœbe felt the school to be infinitely
more attractive than the Blair home. It
was new, it was (Miss Simpson herself said it)
modern, and it was built all of brick. Genevieve
Finnegan, a girl of Phœbe’s own age, declared that
Miss Simpson’s house was stylish; while a teacher,
touching on architecture one day, proudly catalogued
it as “very English.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe did not understand in just what way the
school was “very English,” but she did come to
realize, through Genevieve, that whatever very English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>might be, it was something much to be desired
for any house. As for Grandma’s residence, well,
Genevieve was politely scornful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe readily understood why.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Blair house had gone up when Uncle John
was a baby, and was typical, in its architecture, of
the best suburban houses of those remote times.
It had towers—two of them—round and shingled,
with points that held lightning-rods. It had fancy
cornices, too, and trimmings that were considered
marvels of beauty when they were new. Now
Genevieve referred to them as “ginger bread.” And
it had green blinds on its many windows—blinds
that had rattled in all the storms of the passing
years, but were still intact, testifying to the wood
and workmanship of that period of the long-ago.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the house was “old-fashioned.” There was
no concealing it—everybody in town knew it.
Once, in the days when the Blair house was new,
it had stood all to itself, in the center of what was
known as Blair Farm. The farm had been cut up
into lots later on. Then the big, lonely house
had, as it were, drawn the town lovingly to it,
and had taken its place as a sort of landmark, rearing
its unfashionable turrets among very up-to-date
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>structures. Genevieve and her mamma, and her
papa, together with five servants, were dwellers in
one of these structures. Genevieve referred to her
home—carelessly—as a “chalet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was nothing to be said in criticism of Miss
Simpson’s—even though it was not a chalet. Genevieve
declared, and other girls upheld her, that
Miss Simpson’s was so unusually splendid in the
way of interior woods, marbled entrance hall, frescoed
ceilings and the like that the man who had
put it up had “gone broke.” Genevieve said it
boastfully. How much further, indeed, could any
man go who was putting up a house than to go
broke?</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was convinced.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was quick to admit to herself that, interiorly
at least, there was much to be desired in the way
of improvements at Grandma’s. If the big Blair
house was not comparable to Miss Simpson’s, it
was also far from coming up to the standard of
apartments in New York. For example, consider
the wall-paper on Grandma’s ceilings, and the colored
glass in certain of Grandma’s doors. Crayon
reproductions of family photographs were not at
all “the thing,” Phœbe knew and Genevieve averred.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Neither were wax flowers modish—and Grandma
had so many frames of them! And then there
was that little item of lace curtains. Phœbe did
not have to be told that nobody who really knew
would, in these later and wiser times, go out and
buy lace curtains.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe did not see the upper floors of Miss
Simpson’s; but the street floor was proof of what
might be expected at the top of the graceful stairway.
How beautiful the great drawing-room was,
with its satin-wood walls, carved and bracketed for
silk-covered shades. How deep the great rugs
were in all the big downstairs rooms! And there
were velvet couches on either side of the library
fire, and here, before a glowing hearth, Miss Simpson
gathered her girls of an afternoon for the
function of tea. The maid who served the tea
wore a cap. And on no account did she ever lift
her eyes to smile, as Sophie smiled. What was
most important, this maid referred to Miss Simpson
as “Madam.” And Phœbe knew this was most
proper and desirable. For Sally had always called
Mother “Madam.” If Phœbe had not known about
all this, Genevieve would have been the one to teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>her, Genevieve being a stickler for all that was
proper and—fashionable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe came to look upon the tea-function at
Miss Simpson’s as a rare privilege. This was because
only a certain very small group of girls in
town might share the opportunity of attending that
daily function. For Miss Simpson’s School, as
Uncle John had said, and as had been borne out
architecturally and otherwise—Miss Simpson’s
School was most exclusive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Freed from long weeks of loneliness, Phœbe welcomed
the School with delight. She felt it rightful
that she should be there, too. For was not her
Uncle John the most fashionable rector in town?
Was not her Uncle Bob a Judge?—that he was
Judge of the new Court for Juveniles subtracting
only a little from the honors that were his. And
was not her father, her dear, gallant, handsome
father, a mining-engineer? And were not mining-engineers
in the same class, socially, as doctors,
and lawyers, and bankers, and mayors of the city?
Genevieve said so.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Phœbe, welcomed to the School by Miss Simpson,
received into the exclusive tea circle before
that library fire, and made one of a little “set” of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>pupils out of well-to-do families—Phœbe began to
feel at home in this small, new city, to fret less
for the dear mother who was taking such a long
time to get well, and to put behind her all thoughts
of the something which she had not understood.
In fact, Phœbe was coming to be almost patient,
almost happy and contented once more.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then, one morning, with the same suddenness
that had found her free of restraint and bewildering
conjectures, there came another change.</p>

<p class='c008'>How it came she scarcely knew. Why it came,
she had no idea. It was there—all about her—like
the air; no, more like an obscuring smoke. She
could not see what was wrong. But she could feel.
Phœbe curtsied to Miss Simpson and that august
principal did not smile. And there were other
signs—signs that struck a chill to Phœbe’s tender
heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe did not ask any questions. New Year’s
Day had ended a wonderful life. This new life
was baffling; full of cruel blows. “Submit,” counseled
a still, small voice; “submit, and wait for
Mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The hot tears stung the gray-blue eyes. Phœbe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>blinked them away, opened her Physical Geography,
and smiled bravely at a picture of a chimpanzee
climbing a cocoanut tree.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe smiled—but she awaited a new blow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe was very busy. With the wet half of
an old handkerchief, she wiped off the top of her
own desk most painstakingly; next, having dried it
with the bit of worn linen kept in reserve, she
cleared out the shelf of the desk, dusting each book
as she did so, and then washed and dried the shelf.
Last of all, she took out her inkwell, cleaned the
lid of it, refilled it carefully from a nearby bottle,
and replaced it without the loss of a purple drop.
All the while she hummed a little, and was so intent
upon her work that she seemed not to know that
the other girls were leaving one by one—until no
one was left with her in the high room, which once
had been a music-room, save a teacher, seated
quietly at her desk.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe, despite all her earnest washing-up,
had only been killing time. She had not glanced
up from her work because she did not care to meet
the eyes, or note the whispers, of the other girls.
She would not pass out with them across the terrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>which fronted the big house for fear they might
not walk with her, or call a pleasant good-bye. She
was waiting, busy meanwhile, until she could leave
Miss Simpson’s alone.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher, setting her own desk to rights, cast
an inquiring look at Phœbe every now and then.
When the last fellow-pupil was gone, Phœbe rose
and came forward to the platform, a little timidly.
In front of the big desk, she halted. Her cheeks
were pink—too pink. Her lips were pressed together.
But her eyes smiled bravely. Back went
one brown shoe, and the slender, stockinged legs
bent in a curtsey.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-night, Miss Fletcher,” said Phœbe, politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good-night, dear.” Miss Fletcher’s voice was
curiously husky. And as Phœbe turned to leave,
the teacher rose abruptly, banged a ruler upon the
green slope of oil-clothed board in front of her,
opened and shut a drawer noisily, and dabbed at
her eyes alternately with the back of a hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe was going cheerily enough. She said
her usual good afternoon to the black-clad, white-aproned
maid at the front door, did a hop-skip
across the patterned bricks of the wide terrace, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>went trippingly down the winding steps that led to
the gate and the street.</p>

<p class='c008'>A limousine was waiting there—a long, gleaming,
tawny vehicle with brown trimmings. Phœbe
recognized the motor. It was Genevieve Finnegan’s,
and it called for Genevieve every school afternoon.
Phœbe had seen other cars of the same
color flashing hither and thither through the town.
The Finnegans, it was rumored, had five automobiles
in their big garage. And Genevieve had been
heard to say, though it was scarcely believable, that
of the five cars one was kept solely for the use of
the Finnegan servants! Servants! And Uncle John
still clinging to a surrey and a horse with no check-rein
and a long tail!</p>

<p class='c008'>As Phœbe sped down the last half-dozen steps
to the sidewalk, she did not even raise her eyes to
the proud countenance of the smartly liveried Finnegan
chauffeur. All day she had been troubled,
knowing herself covertly discussed, and slyly
ignored. Now, of a sudden, at sight of this huge
testimony to many dollars and much power, she felt
strangely helpless, alone, poor, and ashamed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her unwonted attention to her desk had made
her a quarter of an hour late. She knew that Uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>John and Grandma were, even now, keeping an
eye on the clock, or peering out of a window to
see whether or not she was coming through the
driveway gate. She hurried along, eyes straight
ahead.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she walked, her lips moved. Over and over,
she was repeating certain things that she had heard
the girls say that day—and certain things that she
had said in reply. For instance, Olive Hayward
had spoken of the graduation exercises, to be held
early in June. And when Phœbe had interposed,
but very meekly, to inquire what part the younger
pupils would take, Olive, who was fully as round,
Phœbe decided, as Uncle Bob himself—Olive had
said, with a queer glance at the girls grouped with
her, “Oh, do you think you’ll still be here?” “I
think I will,” Phœbe had answered, and the girls
had laughed!</p>

<p class='c008'>Why?</p>

<p class='c008'>And then there were other things. Phœbe revolved
around the end of the home gate, closed it
even as she started up the walk, bumped in surprise
against the new screen door put up that day
against winged intruders, sped along the hall, taking
off the serge coat as she went, and entered the living-room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>breathless, casting aside her hat with one
hand and her coat with the other. She seized the
squat stool upon which Uncle Bob, when reading,
liked to rest his feet, carried it to a high, old mirror
that had, in its time, reflected Grandma in her
bridal gown, and stood upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, young lady?” It was Uncle Bob, from
the far corner where was the telephone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was turning herself before the mirror—now
this way, now that. “Excuse me, please,” she
begged; “just a minute—something—I must see—right
away—very important—before I change.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I should say!” agreed her uncle, watching her
curiously. “What seems to be the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She came about to face him. Her brows were
knit. Her eyes were troubled. “That’s just what—what
I don’t know,” she admitted. “My dress is
all right.—<i>Is</i> there anything wrong with my dress?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He got up and crossed to her. His underlip was
thrust out, as if he were angry. But he answered
lightly enough. “Wrong? Not unless mine eyes
deceive me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was turning again more slowly. “I
thought maybe my petticoat was showing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a sign of it.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“But, Uncle Bob——!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes? What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get right behind me,—straight behind.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here I am.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Uncle Bob, is there a hole in my stocking?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked—now at one slim leg, now at the
other. “There certainly is not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She got down, her eyes solemn. “Uncle Bob,”
she confided, “I don’t know what to make of it.
But all today, at school, the girls have stared, and
stared, and—and whispered. I was sure something
was wrong—with my hair, or my dress. And they
were too—too polite to tell.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Polite, you call ’em!” And Phœbe noted how
Uncle Bob’s chest rose, so that the front edges of
his coat drew apart. Just over the top of his collar,
too, his neck grew scarlet. “Staring and whispering!
The ill-bred chits!”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe was not angry—only puzzled. “It’s—it’s
another mystery,” she said, almost under her
breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!”—her Uncle came to stand beside her, and
he, too, lowered his voice—“do you know, I don’t
believe I like that Simpson School! Suppose we
just cut it out?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>The light in her eager eyes answered him. She
had been wondering just how she could go on at
Miss Simpson’s, with the girls acting so queerly,
and not asking her to walk home with them, or sit
with them under the school arbor during the morning
study-hour. “You mean, Uncle Bob,” she
breathed incredulously, “that I won’t have to go to
Miss Simpson’s any more?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, something on that order.” The Judge
smiled a wide, tooth-revealing smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>But his news was too good to be true. “Has
Daddy said so?” she wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He hasn’t, but I’ve a strong idea that he will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I’m glad!” She took a deep breath. “Because,
Uncle Bob, I’ve felt—well, so queer at school
for several days. You know—uneasy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded. “I know.” And more confidentially,
leaning down to say it, “I’ve heard of other girls—oh,
extra fine girls—who felt exactly like you do
about Miss Simpson’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe was scarcely listening. A new plan—a
wonderful, heart-stirring plan—had come to her,
following on the thought that now her days were
again free. “Oh, Uncle Bob,” she began, “if I don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>have to go to school again, maybe Daddy will let
me go West! To Mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her uncle backed a step; his look lifted to the wall
behind her. He slapped one plump hand with the
other, pursing his lips thoughtfully. “Mm—er—yes,”
he observed; then turning away, “I’m afraid
we haven’t made things very lively for you here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It isn’t that,” she protested. “I’ve had Daddy.
And I love to be here with all of you. You’re
all so nice to each other—never cross. But—but,
Uncle Bob, I’m beginning to—to miss my Mother.”
Her look beseeched him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat down, holding out his hands to her, and
she came to stand at his knee. “If you have to stay
a little longer with us,” he said gently, “you can
be out-doors every one of these sunny Spring days,
and you can plant a garden. And when it rains,
well, this isn’t a little, tucked-up New York apartment—this
big house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked around, nodding. “It’s terribly big,”
she declared. “So many rooms, and so far up to
the ceiling. At first I almost got lost—you remember?
To go anywhere, you have to travel so
much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob laughed, and drew her to him. “You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>blessed!” he said. “Of course it’s big. Why, there’s
room enough here to swing a cat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” agreed Phœbe, “but I don’t want to swing
a cat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I mean”—Uncle Bob was shaking precisely like
the more substantial portion of a floating-island
pudding!—“that you can stretch yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.” Phœbe shook her head with decision.
“No, Uncle John doesn’t like me to stretch. He
says, ‘Ladies don’t do it’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, you funny little tyke!” cried Uncle Bob.
“Can’t you run, and romp, and play?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In here?” she asked, swinging an arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, dumpling!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” answered Phœbe, as certain as before.
“I’d bother Uncle John when he’s writing a sermon.
So Saturdays, when I’m here, I just stand
at a window if I can’t play out in the yard. I just
stand and look out. But I can’t see much—even
upstairs. Because this house is so awfully low
down, next the ground.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Low down!” ejaculated her uncle, amazed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. In New York, our apartment was ’way
high up in the building, and we could look over
the tops of houses to the River. And the other direction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>oh, there was a wonderful moving-picture
theatre, and——” She stopped, suddenly remembering.</p>

<p class='c008'>But her Uncle Bob smiled at her kindly. “And
what about that theatre?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I went lots of evenings, before Mother was so
sick—just Mother and I went, or Sally took me.
My! but I love the movies!” Then, fearing he
might misjudge her, “I loved the nights we stayed
at home, too. They were so cosy. Daddy would
be gone, or busy, or just downtown. So Mother
would sit at the window in her room, in a big chair,
and I’d sit on her knees. Of course, my legs are
long, and they hung over. So we just put a stool
close by to hold up my feet, and then—then Mother
would sing to me.” Her lips trembled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Darling!” said Uncle Bob, tenderly. There were
tears in her eyes, but she was smiling through them
bravely at this uncle who seemed always to understand
her. Whereupon he smiled, too, and kissed
her. “Maybe Grandma can hold you like that,
in a big chair, sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid she isn’t strong enough,” answered
Phœbe. “And then, maybe she wouldn’t know just
how to sing.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I see.” He pondered the problem a moment.
“Well, of course, I can hold you. But about the
singing—just what was it that Mother sang?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, she just made it up as she went along—to
suit the occasion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He put his arms about her then, and held her
close. And there was a long pause.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her eyes were brimming. And presently, with
a long sigh, she spoke again: “Oh, how I like
my mother to hold me!”—it was scarcely more than
a whisper. “I like her arms, and the place just
here on her shoulder.” The coat under her cheek
was checked. She touched a black square with a
finger. “And she uses perfumery on her hair. Oh,
Uncle Bob, I love her hair! I—I love my mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She wept then, without restraint. And the Judge,
awkwardly, and puffing not a little with the effort,
gathered her up in his arms and held her, whispering
to her, straining the little figure to his
breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t say anything to Daddy,” she sobbed.
“Oh, Uncle Bob! Uncle Bob!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He patted her shoulder. He laid a big cheek
against her wet, baby-soft face. He rocked her
gently, yearning over her with all the fatherliness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of his big heart. How many times, as Grandma
told her, had tearful little ones cried out to him
where he sat in his lofty chambers at the Court
House! How often had his tender sympathy
wrapped them about like a robe—the mistreated,
the lonely, the children that lacked love! But here,
calling upon him for help in her suffering, was one
dearer than all others, of his own blood. And what
would he do to help her?</p>

<p class='c008'>“When can I see Mother?” she asked. “When?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Give us all time,” he pleaded. “I know how
it is, but try to bear it—try to wait. It’ll all come
out right somehow—it’s got to, Phœbe. Oh, it’s
got to!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt that he understood, that he grieved with
her, that her heartache was his own.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The blow she awaited fell—twenty-four hours
later.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe spent much of that twenty-four hours in
conjectures. And the final and pathetic conclusion
to which she came was that she had done
something wrong, something “awful bad,” though
what it was she could not guess. But whatever it
was, it was so terrible that the girls at Miss Simpson’s
had turned against her.</p>

<p class='c008'>And what about Miss Simpson herself? Phœbe
understood that Miss Simpson was a personage in
the community. Though her school was not the
only one of its kind in the place, it was the only one
that counted. To be, or not to be, a “Simpson
girl” meant, on the one hand, membership in that
exclusive very young crowd; on the other, almost
complete ostracism from it. Miss Simpson had in
her hands (everybody knew it) the social future of
the town’s growing girls.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe’s cry over, Uncle Bob had gone to join
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>his two brothers in the library. A conference began
there, Phœbe felt sure; she was certain, too,
that she was the subject of it. As she paused
at the foot of the stairs—this just outside the library
door—she heard Grandma’s voice, too. Grandma
was weeping!</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe went up to her room. She stole up, on
tiptoe, guiltily. Her brows were puckered, her eyes
wide, her lips pursed. She forbore to steady herself
by a hand on the banisters, lest they creak.</p>

<p class='c008'>As she went, she made a resolve. It had to do
with Sophie. In a way, of course, Sophie could
not be trusted. For though on occasions Sophie
seemed to belong on Phœbe’s side—in a dividing
of the household which existed only in Phœbe’s
mind—at other times the maid swung over to the
clique of grown-ups, and Phœbe was left, as it
were, on the defence, alone. Yet Phœbe had discovered
that now and again it was possible to get
information from Sophie. Phœbe’s resolve was to
“pump” Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arrived in her room, she gave herself up, a second
time, to a close scrutiny of herself in the glass.
First, she looked at her clothes, feeling that, after
all, there was some fault in them (and Uncle Bob,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>though a Judge, was only a man, after all, and
could not competently pass on the matter of a girl’s
dress). Having satisfied herself that there was
nothing glaringly faulty in her dress, Phœbe took
her hand-mirror and went to a window; and seating
herself, examined her face, hair and throat—critically,
unsparingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once she had asked her mother if she was pretty.
And Mother—herself so beautiful!—had answered,
with a kiss, “Of course <i>I</i> think so.” But now,
Phœbe asked herself, was this quota of hair, features
and slender neck considered attractive in the
eyes of those who did not love her?</p>

<p class='c008'>Every freckle and flaw stood out alarmingly in
the afternoon light. Phœbe concluded that in point
of good looks she brought nothing to Miss Simpson’s
School. And as she had no money, like
Genevieve Finnegan——</p>

<p class='c008'>She put down the mirror and went to the closet.
In the daytime, she was never afraid to open the
door of the closet. That nameless, terrifying Thing
which made the place dreaded at night, went higher,
after sun-up, so Phœbe believed, to lurk in the cave-like
storage places that, sloping of roof, opened
off the attic.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>She had not many dresses in the closet. She
touched each in turn. Then she stood for a few
minutes on the threshold of the closet to get a
general and comprehensive idea of her little wardrobe.
After which, hunting her old doll, she went
back to the window to think.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grandma, weeping—that seemed, to her, the
thing most significant. Why was Grandma weeping?
“No,” said Phœbe, solemnly, to the doll, “it
isn’t my face, and it isn’t my clothes.” For, after
all, when it came to looks, Phœbe felt herself to
be better looking than, say, Genevieve. And there
were two or three other girls at Miss Simpson’s
who were, if proud, quite plain. As for clothes,
Grandma had no need to feel badly about them;
all she had to do was order more!</p>

<p class='c008'>It was, indeed, a mystery. Phœbe tried to remember
any story that resembled hers among all
the moving-pictures she had ever seen. She could
remember a little girl who stole jam, and another
little girl who stole watermelons. But she had
taken nothing, had done no wrong wilfully. At
that, the tears of self-pity flowed. She hid her face
against the doll.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then—of a sudden—she felt she knew! Prayers!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>That was it! The girls had discovered, somehow,
that Phœbe had only recently learned to pray!
She stood up, dropping the doll to the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mother had never taught her to pray. And once
when Phœbe had asked about prayers (having seen
two children kneeling beside their father’s chair in
a moving-picture), Mother had answered, rather
sharply, “I don’t believe in teaching innocent little
tots that they’re full of sin. It’s wicked.” But
Grandma—when she found that Phœbe did not
know “Now I lay me”—Grandma had knelt down
beside Phœbe (they were in Phœbe’s room) and
implored God to touch Phœbe’s heart, and claim
Phœbe’s love. And a day or two later, Uncle John
had called Phœbe into the library, where Phœbe
had learned “Now I lay me,” and the Lord’s Prayer,
and had listened to a very great deal that Uncle
John said, the sum and substance of which was that
Phœbe’s ignorance in the matter of prayers was so
shocking as to be beyond even Uncle John’s power
to express. Phœbe gathered further, though her
uncle was discreet when it came to naming anyone
who should be blamed, that Mother, yes, and
Daddy, were equally culpable, and that Phœbe had
virtually been snatched from the burning.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>So—Phœbe decided—it was the prayers. True,
she had prayed faithfully for the past two or three
months. But the girls had discovered about the
unlucky thirteen years and more that went before!</p>

<p class='c008'>Something pounded in Phœbe’s throat. And
there by the window, one knee on the forgotten
doll, she bowed herself....</p>

<p class='c008'>Later, when she went down to supper, she felt
more certain than ever that she was right. It was
the prayers! For as she entered the dining-room,
guiltily, wistfully, on slow foot, and with lowered
look, nobody greeted her cheerily. Her father
kissed her, but absent-mindedly. He ate without
speaking. Uncle John was silent, too—and stern.
Uncle Bob made one or two pathetic attempts to
start conversation, but Phœbe could see that even
jolly Uncle Bob——! And Grandma, pressing
dainties upon Phœbe, and smiling tenderly (with
swollen eyes), was plainly anxious and disturbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>So was Sophie! True, she winked at Phœbe
once during the course of the meal. But it was a
solemn wink. Her manner was subdued. She
moved carefully, rattling no dishes. Phœbe caught
the girl’s eyes upon her more than once. Phœbe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>understood the look—it was all examination, and
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can Sophie take me upstairs?” asked Phœbe,
at bedtime. The uncles were back in the library
once more, and Phœbe’s father was with them. But
there was no sound of argument.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you—lonesome?” returned Grandma. And
her head shook very much.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’d like to have Sophie go up with me,” Phœbe
answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when she and Sophie were upstairs, alone,
and the latter had finished her pillow-beating,
Phœbe asked no questions. She feared to; and
she knew that Sophie would not go without some
word, some hint.</p>

<p class='c008'>It came. “Miss Simpson was in to see your
Grammaw this afternoon,”—this casually, with a
quick look; then, “Did you know it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was equally adroit. “She was?” she asked
indifferently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yop. I don’t like that woman.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie went. And Phœbe, left behind in the
dark, lay thinking. Miss Simpson had called!
Uncle Bob had not mentioned it. Why? And why
had Miss Simpson called? What had she told or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>asked? Phœbe knew that it was this visit which
had made Uncle Bob decide against Phœbe’s continuing
at the school.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the five grown men and women in the big
rooms below could have known how grievously
Phœbe’s ignorance of any part of the real truth
was torturing the child, then each, and all, would
have hastened up the stairs to that little figure,
turning and tossing, as the bewildered brain strove
to arrive at facts. For though the facts were bad
enough, Phœbe’s guesses were far more terrible.
She did not pray, or weep. She lay and planned
how she would run away—to Mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>But she was quite herself in the morning. When
she awoke, the sight of branches against her windows—lovely,
green, tree-top branches, of sunlight
streaming in, the songs of birds coming faintly, and
loud cock-crows, all these drove away magically the
fear and ache and loneliness of the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>She remembered that she did not have to go to
school—and was glad! Why, it was quite like a
Saturday! Freedom, no sermons, no admonitions
to be quiet of foot and voice! And had she not
heard about some little new ducks that were about
to hatch?</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>She sprang up. She kissed her mother’s photograph
with a smiling kiss. She sang over her dressing.
She showed a sunny face at the breakfast-table,
where Uncle John ate silently, and Uncle Bob
sat behind his paper. The night before, what a
sense of guilt was hers! It was gone. Her good-morning
was merry. She winked back saucily at
Sophie’s wink, and ate her oatmeal with good appetite.
Grief and fourteen, how short was their stay
together! For she was entirely overlooking the
fact that this was the day she was intending to
run away!</p>

<p class='c008'>“And what’s my little daughter figuring on doing
this morning?” her father asked; “—lucky Phœbe,
who doesn’t have to be shut up in school!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe thought perhaps the ducks were hatched
by now.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hatched and swimming in Uncle Bob’s pool,”
announced Grandma. “And the poor mother-hen
is so worried——!”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that, Uncle Bob came out from behind his
paper—came out like the sun from behind a cloud.
And he had another cup of coffee, and threw a violet
across the table to Phœbe, and pretended to be
shocked at the conduct of the ducks. So that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Phœbe laughed, and Grandma and Daddy smiled—yes,
even Uncle John smiled. Breakfast was cheerful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gray eyes thoughtful, Phœbe fell to contrasting it
with breakfasts in New York; the contrast was the
sharper when each of Grandma’s three sons pushed
back his chair in turn and gave his mother a hearty
kiss. What a lot of kissing went on at Uncle Bob’s!
Everyone kissed Grandma good-morning and good-night.
In New York, Daddy kissed Phœbe, and
Mother kissed Phœbe: each other they did not
kiss.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe thought of this again later in the day,
when Genevieve came. For it was Genevieve who
delivered the blow!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Genevieve was Phœbe’s own age, but stockily
built, with an up-turning Irish nose, reddish corkscrew
curls, and freckles. She had a proud, conscious
mouth, and her teeth were large. Her eyes
were almost as red as her hair, and small. Around
them the skin crinkled up when she laughed, shutting
them away completely. When she had something
important to say, she had a trick of throwing
her head back with a toss of the curls. Phœbe
had noted the trick. Once or twice she had even
practiced it in front of her mirror!</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve was more overdressed than usual for
her call on Phœbe. She had a well wrapped package
under one arm, and she wasted no time in delivering
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve brought back your books,” she explained,
and proffered the package.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe stared. “My books?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“From Miss Simpson’s.” Genevieve laid them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>on the sitting-room table and sat, arranging her
skirt grandly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe still stared. It was as if she had unexpectedly
been struck. Of course, if she was not to
continue at the school—— And yet to have her
books sent after her——!</p>

<p class='c008'>“When my motor called for me,” went on Genevieve,
“I had my chauffeur put them in the car,”—this
with a graceful wave of the hand toward the
package. “‘It’s no trouble,’ I said to Miss Simpson,
‘as long as I have my own motor, and my
chauffeur.’ And Miss Simpson said, ‘Thank you,
my dear. Then Phœbe won’t have to come back’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe’s slender body stiffened. “<i>She</i> said I
won’t have to?” she demanded. “You mean my
Uncle Bob said it.” Then as Genevieve’s brows and
shoulders lifted simultaneously, “Oh, Genevieve,
all the girls have acted so funny. What’s the matter?
Do you know?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve smoothed the crisp folds of her taffeta
dress. “I’d rather not say,” she declared, importantly
evasive.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe was not to be put off. “Oh, please,
Genevieve!” she entreated. “Tell me! Have I
done anything?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“N-n-n-no.” Then, raising her eyes to Phœbe’s
anxious face, “You—you haven’t heard anything?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe shook her head. “Is it because we haven’t
got an automobile?” she ventured; “only a horse
and a surrey?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The reddish eyes disappeared as Genevieve
laughed—musically, in the most approved Simpson
manner. “Oh, several of the girls at the School
are awfully poor,” she reminded. “I let them ride
in my car. But”—significantly—“they have fine
standing, Miss Simpson says. And they’ve never
had any scandal.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Vaguely Phœbe caught the inference. “Oh, yes;
scandal,” she said, almost under her breath. “That
would be awful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve reached to touch Phœbe’s arm condescendingly.
“Don’t you care,” she counseled,
“because I like you just the same.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe fell back. Her face paled; her heart
pounded. Scandal! and she was on the verge of
knowing just what was meant. She thought of the
prayers. She longed to know the worse. “Genevieve,”
she whispered, “have I—what scandal?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s funny you don’t know,” marveled Genevieve.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Oh, what is it? Please! <i>Please!</i>” Phœbe’s lips
were trembling.</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve, having postponed her informing to
her own complete satisfaction, now saw that the
moment was ripe for her climax. “Phœbe,” she began
solemnly, “Miss Simpson doesn’t want you at
our school because your mother’s in Reno.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Reno?” repeated Phœbe. Her face lighted joyously.
Mother was in Reno! And if she were to
carry out that plan to run away——! And after all,
it was not the prayers!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nevada,” added Genevieve, with finality. The
other’s relief irritated.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Phœbe’s turn to toss her head. “Nevada
is good for my mother’s cough,” she declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” said Genevieve. “Well, everybody says
your mother’s gone West—hm!—for another reason.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s sick,” returned Phœbe, quietly. “And it’s
smart—Mother said so—to go to Florida or West
when you’re sick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Once more Genevieve shrugged. “Of course,
you ought to know about your own mother. But
anyhow there was something in the papers—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>New York papers. It was a printed telegram from
Nevada.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Certainly there was,” Phœbe agreed. “Because
my mother’s a New Yorker, and so the newspapers
print that she’s out there. They’d be sure to. She’s
so beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve rose abruptly. “Oh, all right!” she
retorted. “But beautiful or not, all the same you
can’t blame Miss Simpson. She doesn’t want a girl
in her school that’s got a mother that’s divorced.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Di-vorced!</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve’s eyes shone. It was the effect she
wanted. She moved toward the door. “Well, I
must be going,” she announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe led the way. In the hall, she turned up
the stairs without even a glance toward her departing
visitor. Her throat ached. There was a
sinking feeling under the high, wide belt of her
gingham dress. She longed for the seclusion of
her room—<i>no</i>, for the darkness of the clothes-closet.
She gained it, going unsteadily. She closed
the door. Then she sank beside the suit-case and
laid her head upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Divorce! She knew what that meant. Over
and over she had seen it all in the “movies”. Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>father would no longer be married to her mother:
The two might not live in the same house: Her
mother would not even dare to come to Grandma’s!</p>

<p class='c008'>Something seemed to seize her then, to press
upon her from all sides, to crush and smother her.
With head lowered, and face down, the blood came
charging up her throat, so that she went dizzy,
and felt nauseated. A chill shook her as she lay.
She thought of death, and prayed for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I died, they’d both be sorry,” she told herself,
“and maybe then they wouldn’t be divorced.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Next, overwhelmingly, came a longing to see her
mother. “I’ll go,” she determined.</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat up. And in the dark of the closet, with
the door shut, and as noiselessly as possible, she
packed the suit-case.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The suit-case packed, Phœbe sat down upon it—to
think. She had known even as she took down
and folded her dresses that she could not really
run away. But the packing had served as a physical
relief to her mental anguish. Also, she had
hoped in her secret heart that she might be discovered
at her packing!—discovered and comforted;
more: the ready suit-case, the threatened
departure by night, alone, might bring her father
and her uncles to believe that the wisest thing they
could do would be to send her to her mother. Oh,
how she longed for her mother!</p>

<p class='c008'>The tears came then, and she wept, her head
bowed upon her knees. Divorce! Never again the
dear apartment with mother and Daddy—the beloved
home-nest, with its ivory woodwork and rose
hangings, its perfumed warmth, and beauty and
cosiness. Her mother and father were to be forever
apart—forever!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sorrow broke over her like a wave. “Forever!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>she wept. “Forever!” There was something almost
delicious about the very force and keenness
of her grief. She was going through a crisis
such as she had seen pictured upon the screen.
And the very word Forever augmented her suffering
and that sense of curious gratification in
the undergoing of such agony.</p>

<p class='c008'>So again and again she went back over the cause
of her weeping. Divorce! They were to be separated
during all the coming years, those two whom
she loved so dearly. Never again might she have
them together, with her, one at each hand. Always
now there would be the pain of having Mother
gone if she, Phœbe, was with Daddy; of having
Daddy gone if she was with Mother. Always it
would be like that—like now.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then her resentment rose against those two
loved ones. “Oh, what’s the matter with them!
What’s the matter with them!” she burst out. That
father who seemed so gallant and fine—how could
her mother bear to be away from him? And
Mother, beautiful, sweet, altogether adorable—what
more did her father ask? They were through
with each other! Oh, why? And then, melting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>once more, Oh, how could she bear it! Oh, Mother!
Mother!—Oh, dear Daddy!</p>

<p class='c008'>Next, of a sudden, a more terrible thought:
Would the divorce of her parents mean that she
might not be allowed to see her mother again?</p>

<p class='c008'>The very possibility brought her to her feet and
out of the closet. “No! I won’t stand it!” she
cried. “I must have Mother! I won’t stay here!
I won’t! I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was immediately all resolution. She washed
her face. Then she took off the dress she was wearing—her
grandmother had bought it—and opening
the suit-case, chose and put on a dress of her
mother’s buying. Thus fortified, as it were, in
something that had been touched by hands dear
beyond expression, she descended to the library.
She hoped all the grown-ups would be there on her
arrival. She longed to announce defiantly her plan
to leave.</p>

<p class='c008'>But—only Uncle John was in the room, leaned,
as always, over his papers and his great flat-topped
table. He did not speak; did not even look up—as
Phœbe advanced to a stand before the large map
of the United States which hung above the bookcases
at one side of the room.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Ah, what a great distance lay between! Here,
a small dot and small letters showed the position
of the town where she was; there, a larger dot and
larger letters marked the spot where Mother had
gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Standing before the map, with face raised, once
more anger possessed her—a fierce anger—against
this town in which she was, against everyone in it.
There had been a time when she had fretted because
she could not go about like other girls, and
meet people; now she felt she did not want to
go anywhere, did not want to meet anyone, know
anyone, make any friends!</p>

<p class='c008'>They did not like her mother? They talked
against her mother? Very well. They need not
like her, either. They could talk against her if
they wanted to!</p>

<p class='c008'>Her resentment demanded action. There was a
drug-store down the street, two blocks away. To
reach it from the Blair front gate, one had to pass
a dozen houses. There were always people on the
porches of those houses, or on the lawns. Phœbe
went upstairs for her New York hat, and for her
purse. There was ice-cream soda to be had at the
drug-store, and sundaes of every description.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Phœbe liked them. But they were not, just then,
first in her thoughts. Did Genevieve Finnegan,
and others like her, expect Phœbe Shaw Blair to
hide herself away in Grandma’s big house? To
weep alone at slights? “From such small-town
people?” raged Phœbe, as she slammed the front
door. Did they think she would act as if she were
ashamed of her mother?</p>

<p class='c008'>Her hat on the back of her head, her head in
the air, Phœbe let herself out of the front gate
and started for the drug-store. And on the way,
she passed every one of those dozen houses without
so much as a glance!</p>

<p class='c008'>It was a pleasure to do that. She arrived at the
drug-store in great good humor. She felt that she
had done something for Mother!</p>

<p class='c008'>She was in a reckless mood. She enjoyed one
soda and two ice-creams. She ignored the pretty
young woman who waited upon her. When she
started homeward, she went with a light step and
a high chin. She wished she had a dog to lead.
Not that she cared for dogs—she was afraid of
them. But if she were leading a dog, he would be
an excuse for running, and calling out happily.
That was what she most wished to do—call out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>happily, and skip—just to show all those gaping
neighbors how little she cared!</p>

<p class='c008'>She compromised on a rubber ball. It was an inspiration!
The moment she stepped upon the front
porch, here was Uncle Bob, dragging the lawn-mower
behind him. She explained that she had
spent every cent she had at the drug-store. At
any other time she would have hesitated to confess
that even to Uncle Bob. But now she was
suddenly indifferent even about what he thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>And Uncle Bob, seeing her cheeks so pink and
her eyes so full of fire, dropped the handle of
the lawn-mower as if it were red-hot, and emptied
one pocket of its silver. “God bless me!” he cried.
“A rubber ball’s a great idea! And if you see anything
else you like——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe took the silver and was off like a shot.
She knew the store that carried toys. She went
without a pause to the toy-counter. There were
other things that she liked,—as Uncle Bob had
suggested—plenty of them. But for them she had
no time. She bought the ball,—a large, gun-metal
affair with a ridge around it like an Equator. She
paid for it with a proud air, not even deigning to
look at the clerk. No, she did not care to have it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>wrapped. And even while the man was sending
away to make change for the half dollar she had
given him, she proceeded to bounce the ball.</p>

<p class='c008'>She bounced it all the way home, not taking her
eyes from it. She ran; she skipped. For her purpose,
the ball was precisely as good as the best dog
would have been. As she played, she knew people
were passing her on the sidewalk; or from porch
or lawn were watching her pass. But she was completely
absorbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>After that, every day for many days she went
at least once to the drug-store. And she bounced
the ball both ways!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Now came the beginning of what was like a new
era of life for Phœbe—an era in which, more keenly
than ever before, she was to understand, and—to
suffer. Up to now she had not by any means been
indifferent to the things that touched her own existence.
And how she had loved and hated, joyed
and sorrowed, with her enthralling favorites of the
screen! But the time was come when she was to
awaken to depths and heights of feeling—depths
and heights all the more strikingly contrasted because
her imagination was film-trained; she was to
regard herself as the central figure in a heart
drama that seemed countless reels long.</p>

<p class='c008'>And about her, who—with her mother away—who
was to take counsel with her, to sympathize,
even to guess one small part of all that which surged
through her young heart?</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the great pipe-organ in Uncle John’s
church that had most to do with her sudden emotional
awakening, with her realization that something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>really momentous had come into her life.
Weeks before she had started to school at Miss
Simpson’s, the church organ had moved her. In
New York, at one of the great temples dedicated to
moving-pictures, she had often listened to the boom
of just such a glorious instrument—listened with
calm interest and pleasure, her hand clasped lovingly
in her mother’s. And the church organ had
not failed to recall to her the theatre, and those
sweet hours that, alas, she had never fully appreciated.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the first Sunday following Genevieve Finnegan’s
visit! The pipe-organ stirred her cruelly.
It spoke her own tragedy—it told the story of her
broken, bankrupt home.</p>

<p class='c008'>She had gone to church meaning to sit up proudly
in the Blair pew, to keep her chin high, and her lips
smiling; to stand and sit and kneel with the greatest
poise, so that those who cared to look would see!—particularly
those who might be sitting directly
behind her. But when the organ broke forth, filling
the high, dim spaces, there swept over her a
realization of the sadness and the finality of the
ending of that New York life which had been so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>sweetly happy. And the young head drooped, the
lashes glistened, the lips trembled pitifully.</p>

<p class='c008'>Standing, she kept her look lowered. Kneeling,
she prayed—but not “Oh, dear God” (as Uncle
John had taught her); instinctively her silent prayer
was addressed to her mother. “Oh, darling, darling!”
she implored, her forehead against the backs
of her small gloved hands. With inward sight she
beheld the loved features, the yearned for arms, the
comforting breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then—remorse. Behind the adored figure, what
was that other? The Christ? Yes. She had seen
Him once. It was in a war picture. A soldier was
dying, alone, in No Man’s Land. And suddenly,
there by the side of the dying had appeared the
One whose look of love and compassion had brought
a smile to the face of the prostrate boy. She must
not pray to her mother. She must pray to Him.
“Oh, dear Jesus,” she plead, “give me back my
mother! Oh, please give me my mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Grandma, shifting upon her old knees, came
nearer to Phœbe by a hand’s breadth. Grandma’s
dress, of wool, and black, with pipings of grosgrain,
had been made for her two years before.
Faintly it smelled of moth-balls.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Phœbe shrank away.</p>

<p class='c008'>That morning Uncle John’s sermon failed to bore
her as usual. She had her thoughts. Only at first
were they miserably unhappy. As Uncle John
progressed, she fell to thinking of a plan: it had
to do with her return to New York. The dear
apartment was still there, even if Mother was West.
Perhaps—undoubtedly!—Sally was still on hand,
black and bland, devoted as ever, and full of her
accustomed gaiety. Why should Phœbe stay in a
town that treated her unkindly and gossiped about
her mother? Why not go back to New York, the
dear home, the fond servant and the enchanting
“movies”?</p>

<p class='c008'>But how could it be managed? She determined
to ask her father.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will go! I will go! I will!” she promised herself.
“I won’t stay here! I hate it! I hate it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She went out of the church with a face so pale
that the blue veins stood forth on her white skin
like tracings of ink. She remembered how screen
actresses bore themselves when they were suffering—how
wistful was their expression, how far-away
was the look in their beautiful eyes. Phœbe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>bore herself like them, walking slowly, with uplifted
countenance. And her pain was real.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a way, Uncle Bob and her father spoiled the
beauty of her keen pain. Arriving home, she found
them on the sunny side of the house, tinkering with
fish-lines. Her father had a can of worms, and
he was adding to them by turning back the winter
banking of sod from the clapboards. They welcomed
her joyously, and coaxed little shrieks from
her by holding out the worm-can. She changed
her dress, and spent the long afternoon at her father’s
heels. The paleness left her face. She consented
to carry the worms, and a shoe-box filled
with sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c008'>But night brought back something of the sweet
grief of the morning. Her father held her for an
hour after supper, seated in a big chair by the sitting-room
hearth. Her cheek against his breast,
she longed to talk to him of her mother—of the
plan that had occurred to her that morning; yet
she dared not. He was not like Uncle Bob, plump
and smiling and full of invitations to confidences:
he was so quiet, and thoughtful, so sombre-eyed,
even mysterious. She felt his mysteriousness most
when she looked at his tight-closed lips, his set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>jaws. And she asked herself, Was he grieving as
she was grieving, and was it about Mother?</p>

<p class='c008'>She sat up in bed that night and read “St. Elmo”,
thrilling over the portions that were full of expressions
of love. For her heart was hungry for affection.
When had she lacked protestations of it,
with Mother near? And Sally had never failed
to tell her that she was dear. Her father was not
demonstrative—never had been. And now all these
others! With the single exception of Uncle Bob
did they ever say kind and tender things?</p>

<p class='c008'>When her light was out, she lay thinking of “St.
Elmo” and of moving-pictures in which children,
or young and beautiful heroines, had been held dear
beyond words. She repeated lines from the screen
that seemed very sweet to her—one in particular:
“<i>Across the world he went, seeking her.</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt her life a failure—her fate unspeakably
sad. She wept, her head in her arms. All
sorts of pictures flashed themselves upon her brain.
And she repeated certain Biblical lines and passages
that she had heard of late, both at home and
at Miss Simpson’s. Somehow just to say them
over exalted her strangely. One was, “Whither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>thou goest I will go”; another, “He that watcheth
over Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She slept at last, the tears on her cheeks. The
pipe-organ had done it all—that and the slowly advancing
vested choir. It had even made her forget,
temporarily, her childish fear of the dark. For
that particular Sunday night was the first night that
she had ever gone to sleep without looking under the
bed and into the clothes-closet.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next morning, waking late, she wanted to
stay where she was, with the shades drawn, and
read “St. Elmo”, and think of sad things, and
say beautiful lines, and enjoy more hours of sweet
unhappiness. But voices called to her from below—Sophie’s,
her father’s, Uncle Bob’s. She kissed
her mother’s picture over and over while putting
on her shoes and her dress, and combing her hair.
When she went down to breakfast she was curiously
unable to eat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doubtless one of the household’s grown-ups, or,
perhaps, all of them, saw that something was wrong,
for that morning, promptly on the stroke of nine,
Phœbe had her first lesson at home. It was Uncle
John who acted as tutor. He had her read to him,
choosing “The Vicar of Wakefield”. As she went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>along, haltingly, he asked her the meaning of words,
and had her shut the book on her forefinger while
she spelled them. He gave her several sums to do,
also, using the arithmetic that Genevieve Finnegan
had brought home from Miss Simpson’s; and they
spent an hour over the globe, revolving it, and
hunting countries and oceans and mountain-chains.
Phœbe knew far more about the world, and what
it looked like, here and there, and its peoples, and
animals, than she dared to admit to Uncle John.
She knew because she had seen so many “travel pictures”.</p>

<p class='c008'>That afternoon she spent in the vegetable garden
with Sophie. The garden was at a far corner of
the Blair grounds, well away from any house. And
Phœbe saw that here was an opportunity to ask
Sophie a few questions—the questions she shrank
from asking anyone else.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know why Miss Simpson didn’t want me at
school any more,” she said, by way of a beginning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie was pulling radishes. “Do y’?” she inquired.
“Wasn’t it—er—because your father
wasn’t payin’ her enough money?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know it wasn’t,” declared Phœbe, bluntly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“You know she wanted me out because my mother
is West, getting a divorce from my father.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My land!” marveled Sophie, sitting back and
staring up. “How’d you ever guess?—Phœbe, you
been listenin’!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Genevieve Finnegan,” said Phœbe, laconically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that little imp!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>You</i> knew all the time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie went back to her garnering. “Oh, yes,”
she admitted proudly. “I showed Miss Royal Highness
Simpson in. And your Uncle John, he tried
to bluff her—told her your mamma wasn’t well,
and so forth. But she didn’t bluff.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She knew,” put in Phœbe, “because there was
a piece in a New York paper.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right y’ are! Well, she didn’t want talk in
her school, she said; didn’t want <i>her</i> little girls,
the angels, to even know there was such a thing as
divorce in the whole world!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s in the movies,” reminded Phœbe. “The
girls all know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Course they do! And when she had somethin’
to say to the Judge, you betcha <i>he</i> told her what’s
what!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good for Uncle Bob!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“He says to her, ‘Miss Simpson, Phœbe will not
remain at your precious school’. And I showed
her out the front door,”—this with a flourish of
her arms, both hands coming to rest on her hips
while she gave a toss of the tousled head.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe touched Sophie on the shoulder. “Is—is
divorce why my mother sent me here?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe, if I tell y’ the truth——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But, then, maybe you don’t know either,” added
Phœbe, adroitly, since she had learned that, with
Sophie, the best method was to belittle Sophie’s
knowledge, and thus strike at her pride.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe I don’t know!” cried Sophie, scornfully.
“I guess I knew all about it before you ever showed
up. Your paw brought you, young lady, without
your mamma knowin’ that he planned to. Now!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sophie!” It was Phœbe’s turn to sit back. She
stared, aghast.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, ma’am. Your paw just naturally stole
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Mother’s telegram! It told me to come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes? Well, your paw sent you that telegram.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe did not speak for a minute. While things
began to clear for her—the swift packing, the sudden
departure from New York, the telegrams that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>had come, one after another, the fact that she had
had no letters, nor been permitted to read those
written her father. Stolen! By her father, from
her mother!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why?” demanded Phœbe, suddenly; then, as
Sophie glanced up, “Why did Daddy steal me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Didn’t want you out there in a divorce town, I
guess.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh. And why was I watched so, and never
taken anywhere for a long time?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I tell y’, you’ll never, never tell?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never, never, <i>never</i>—cross my heart to die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The folks here was afraid your mamma’d steal
you back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was appalled. She got up, and stood over
Sophie, wavering a little, too shocked to speak.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!” comforted Sophie, reaching out her
earth-stained hands. “Dear kiddie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They—they don’t want me to be with Mother?—again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Quickly Sophie averted her eyes. “I wouldn’t
say that,” she declared. “Why, no! Y’ see, it’s this
way: two of ’em here thinks the same about it,
dearie. Your grammaw and the Judge thinks a
little girl is always best off when she’s with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>mother. I heard the Judge say so, and his maw
agreed. But your Uncle John——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe drew in a long, trembling breath. Then,
“I hate him!” she declared. “Because he hates my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You spoke the truth that time,” continued
Sophie. “He married your mamma to Mister Jim,
but he didn’t like her—never. Oh, he’s <i>all</i> on your
paw’s side.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You mean that Daddy——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your daddy don’t say what he thinks,” reminded
Sophie. “But I guess your mamma done
somethin’ that made him pretty mad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe longed to know what, to ask about it.
Yet she shrank from having Sophie tell her anything
that might be in the slightest degree against
her mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know what it was,” Sophie went on.
“But it got so bad between ’em that there just had
to be a split-up. Course your Uncle John’s dead
against divorces, bein’ a minister. The ’Piscopal
Church is like that. And I kinda believe your father
thinks the same way. But your Uncle Bob and your
grammaw say that if a married couple ain’t happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>they oughta sep’rate, and be done with it, and not
quarrel around where there’s a child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe knelt, and put a hand under Sophie’s
chin. “Tell me:” she begged; “When Daddy and
Mother are divorced, what do you think is going
to happen to me?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We-e-ell,”—Sophie considered the question,
pursing her mouth and blinking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, now!” challenged Phœbe, impatiently.
“What do they all say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do they know about your mamma’s
plans?” Sophie retorted. “Maybe she’ll marry
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe threw back her head and laughed.
“Marry again!” she cried. “My mother? She’d
<i>never</i> do that! Never! She’ll come back. And
I’ll live with her. I won’t stay here. Not one minute!
Not——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sh! Sh!” warned Sophie. “Don’t talk so loud.
And just think over this: If your Maw <i>don’t</i>
marry again, maybe Mister Jim won’t let you go
back to her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie shook her head. “I don’t understand it
myself,” she admitted. “Only I know that your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Uncle Bob thinks there oughta be what he calls a
reg’lar new home, with a husband in it to take
care of your mamma.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy would take care of Mother and me,”
declared Phœbe, proudly. “I know Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But y’ see, after a divorce, your Daddy might
want to be dead sure everything was right for you,
and happy, and—and safe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Safe!” repeated Phœbe, disdainful. “You don’t
know New York. What could happen to me or
Mother in our dear little apartment? Why, the
whole thing—marrying again, and not being safe
in New York—it’s just crazy!—Oh, Sophie, how
long will it be before Mother is divorced? Oh, I
hope it’s soon! Then I’ll have her! I’ll have her!
Oh, <i>Sophie</i>!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She gave Sophie a hug, and they promised each
other not to breathe one word of their conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you see how much it’s like a movie?”
Phœbe wanted to know. “Daddy steals me, then
Mother tries to steal me back, then Nevada—why,
it’s <i>exactly</i> like a movie. And a <i>good</i> movie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie thought so too.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That night, at supper, Phœbe viewed the members
of her family with a new eye—with a fresh
understanding. And was thrilled, as well as gratified
in her vanity, by the thought that she knew
quite as much about “everything” as they did. Now
and then she stole a wise glance at Sophie, to which
the latter gave no answering sign.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other thoughts thrilled Phœbe even more:
Daddy had stolen her!—caught her up and carried
her off, precisely like the heroine in a drama! Then
(delicious thought!) dear Mother had sent wire
after wire—probably demanding Phœbe’s return!
And had wanted to steal her back! How? Had
Mother actually been here? Close? Right in the
town? the neighborhood? Had she even caught
glimpses of Phœbe, perhaps?</p>

<p class='c008'>In the hour preceding her going up to bed, as
she strolled with her father to the drug-store and
back, she thought of a great many questions that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>she meant to ask Sophie the very first chance she
had.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chance came that evening. As Phœbe was
on the point of falling asleep, her door opened
stealthily, there was a cautious whisper to allay any
alarm, then the door closed softly and Sophie turned
on the light.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” she began—her face was grave and
her voice anxious; “you won’t say a word about my
tellin’ you what I did this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” declared Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“’Cause if the folks was to find out, they’d fire
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe took Sophie’s hand and made her sit on
the bed. “Oh, there’s more I want to find out,”
she whispered; “—lots more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the folks find out you know,” continued
Sophie, too concerned over her own danger to
think about what Phœbe was saying, “why, it
needn’t be me they blame. ’Cause almost anybody
in town mighta told y’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe stared. “You mean everybody <i>knows</i>?”
she demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everybody ’round here, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I—I didn’t know!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“I’m sorry I told y’.” Sophie turned away her
face. She lifted a corner of her apron to an eye.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Please!” begged Phœbe. “I won’t tell. Honest!
Didn’t I promise? Only I’m—well, I hate to think
about it. Everybody knew—but me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie went then. She would answer no more
questions, vowing she had already told everything
she knew. She left Phœbe quite cast down. It
was one thing to hear such thrilling things about
herself, to realize that she had been the subject of
those long and heated conferences that she knew
had been carried on in the library, to understand
that Grandma had shed tears over her. It was
quite another to find out that the whole town knew.
As far as Phœbe was concerned, finding that out
simply spoiled everything.</p>

<p class='c008'>And now, every week-day morning, she and
Uncle John spent three hours together in the library.
All of the three hours were not spent in actual
study; that is to say, whenever Uncle John got
impatient and wanted to turn to his own work, he
permitted Phœbe to make herself comfortable on
the big, old library couch and read whatever she
liked. With the awakening of her emotions, what
Phœbe liked to read about was love. She found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>some books by “The Duchess”. They were Uncle
Bob’s, and they were full of romance. Phœbe devoured
them—while across the room the clergyman
toiled over a sermon that was, perhaps, concerned
with Peter’s wife’s mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>And every week-day afternoon Phœbe went
driving. With such an unvarying program, she was
able to live up to her determination that she would
never permit herself—in that little, mean, gossiping
town—to make a single friend. And certainly not
now, since she knew that the whole town knew!</p>

<p class='c008'>But she had scarcely made up her mind to remain
cut off completely from everyone (she would
punish them all!) when she made two friends. And
both—though each was so different from the other—soon
became very dear to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was on a Saturday afternoon that the first
came. Phœbe and Uncle Bob were just back from
a drive, and were busy, concocting a lemonade in
the butler’s pantry, when Sophie came bursting in
upon them. The very momentum of her entrance,
the queer, excited look of her (even her hair
seemed to be lifting), told Phœbe that something
unusual had happened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Judge!” whispered Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>He glanced up, half a lemon in each hand, and
damp sugar on his face. Phœbe had pinned one
of Sophie’s aprons about him. He looked comical
enough for the “movies”!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Ruth,” announced Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob stared, as if scarcely comprehending;
then dropped the lemon halves, hastily wiped his
face on the apron, which Sophie unfastened, took
Phœbe by the hand and started for the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who is Miss Ruth?” asked Phœbe as they went.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob smiled down at her. But he did not
seem to see her.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a slender young woman with Grandma
in the sitting-room. She had on a dress that fell
in soft folds, was mistily gray, wide-tucked, and cut
out squarely at the neck to show a strong round
throat. In her hands the visitor held a sun-hat,
black, with a sprinkling of forget-me-nots.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ruth?” said Uncle Bob in greeting. And the
hand that held Phœbe’s trembled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m here with more Court troubles,” explained
Miss Ruth. She was looking at Phœbe. Her eyes
were the color of the flowers on her hat.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“My dear,”—it was Grandma speaking—“this is
Jim’s little girl.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe went forward then. Gravely she took
Miss Ruth’s hand, and made the quick dipping
curtsey that Mother had taught her. “How do you
do,” she said politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth bent and touched Phœbe’s cheek with
her lips. “I’ve wanted to meet you—often,” she
said. Then, as if with sudden feeling, she drew
Phœbe to her, and held her close.</p>

<p class='c008'>The welcome tenderness of it, the embracing
arms, the soft, fragrant dress—it was all like
Mother to Phœbe. Her eyes swam. She reached
up, clasping her arms about Miss Ruth. “Oh, why
haven’t you ever been here before?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha! ha!” laughed Uncle Bob, triumphantly.
“That’s it, Phœbe! Scold her! Scold her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth seemed embarrassed. “I’m so busy
always, dear,” she answered. “But you’ll come to
see me?” Then to Uncle Bob, “Judge, it’s about
the Botts case again.” And to Grandma, “Your son
will wish his Probation Officer didn’t live so close,
bothering him of a Saturday like this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“M-m-m!” commented Uncle Bob. He gave her
a long, grave look.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“I’ve just had a telephone message from the
Botts’s nearest neighbor,” went on Miss Ruth.
“And I felt sure you’d want to do something about
it before Monday. Judge, Mrs. Botts has been
whipping Manila again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, that woman!” scolded Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s a step-mother, isn’t she, Bob?” inquired
Grandma. There was a gay twinkle in her old
eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s a bad step-mother,” he answered. He
went over to her, leaned down and gave her a resounding
kiss. “But, you see, a Judge is likely to
hear only of the bad ones.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Botts isn’t keeping his word,” reminded
Miss Ruth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” returned Uncle Bob. “He promised
to put a stop to any more whipping. What do you
think we ought to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,”—Miss Ruth hesitated—“of course, you
may not agree, but I’ve been wondering if Manila
wouldn’t like to leave home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose you ask her, Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or if I might send her here to see you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s a good idea. It’ll keep her away from
the Court House, poor youngster.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Miss Ruth made as if to go then. But “What
do you think of our young lady?” he wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just—just what I hoped she’d be like,” Miss
Ruth answered, almost as if to herself. She held
Phœbe away from her a little. “You will come
sometimes to see me, Phœbe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I live very close.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And—and you’ll come to see me?” asked Phœbe,
eagerly. What was it about Miss Ruth that she
liked so well? Miss Ruth was grave. Her look
was tender. The hands that held Phœbe’s were
firm and cool.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you want me to come——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then I’ll come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe rose upon tiptoe. “Could you come after
supper, maybe?” she asked. “That’s—that’s always
the lonesomest time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth nodded. “And perhaps Grandma
will let us have a good talk together upstairs,
before you go to sleep—will you, Mrs. Blair?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe loves stories,” answered Phœbe’s grandmother.
“She misses the moving-pictures she used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>to see. And so if you’d tell her a story some evening,
Ruth,——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Or,” put in Phœbe, quickly, “if you know some
songs—if you’d sing to me, like mother used to
sing. I—I like that.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll come.” Miss Ruth kissed Phœbe again.
“But you’ve Grandma, and Uncle John, and Uncle
Robert, and—and your father——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe raised an eager face. “I’d like to have
you, too. Because,”—her voice faltered—“oh, it
takes an awful lot of love to—to make up for my
mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t fail to come.” Miss Ruth left then, and
Phœbe, with Uncle Bob beside her, stood at the
wide glass door of the sitting-room, watching the
gray dress flutter its way, mistily, across the lawn to
the driveway gate.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, little Phœbe?” said the Judge. He had
her hand, and he squeezed it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe understood. “Uncle Bob,” she confided,
“I like her. And I wish she lived here right with
us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Judge Blair nodded. “Ah, that’s what I’ve been
saying,” he answered; “yes, I’ve been saying that
for years, and years—and years.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe thought about that, wondering what
Uncle Bob meant. Something kept her from asking
him. Was it the strange look on his face as he
watched Miss Ruth go? Or was it the way in
which he went out, hands stuffed in pockets, head
down, grave—curiously unlike his usual smiling
self? And how did he want Miss Ruth to live at
Grandma’s? As a sort of helper, like Sophie?
That was not likely. Perhaps Miss Ruth boarded
nearby, and Uncle Bob wanted her to board at
the Blair house. Phœbe made up her mind to ask
Sophie, source of all confidential information. She
stored up Uncle Bob’s last words so that she could
not fail to remember them: “<i>Yes, I’ve been saying
that for years, and years,—and years.</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>But before her opportunity came to question
Sophie, and while she was still watching out in the
direction Miss Ruth had gone, she saw a strange
little figure coming across the grass—coming slowly,
in fact almost sidling, with glances up at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>higher windows of the house, and those formidable
gingerbread turrets.</p>

<p class='c008'>At first Phœbe was sure that it was a boy, all
dressed up grotesquely, as New York boys dressed
themselves every Thanksgiving Day. For surely
(the figure was close now) no young person ever
could have <i>real</i> hair that was so red, or wear a
hat, except in fun, that was so queer and green.
And then the dress—too loose, and too long. And
the shoes—! So large!</p>

<p class='c008'>Suddenly Phœbe’s heart gave a leap. It was not
a dressed-up boy: It was a girl! “A girl in disguise!”
concluded Phœbe, excitedly, with moving-picture
plots springing to her mind. “And she’s
flying from the enemy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl halted at a little distance, fearfully.
Then Phœbe went out to meet her, and also halted.
The two looked at each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you come in?” asked Phœbe at last, politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>The girl hung her head.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Come on in,” persisted Phœbe. “Nobody’s
going to hurt you.” She turned and led the way,
and the girl followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was about Phœbe’s own age, but pale, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>looked ill-fed and unhappy. Her eyes were so light
a gray that they seemed colorless, and milky. Her
under-jaw had a way of dropping. Her hands were
soiled, and red.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You needn’t be afraid, little girl,” declared
Phœbe, when they were in the sitting-room, and the
door to the lawn was shut. “You just tell me what
you want.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the other seemed tongue-tied. Her mouth
was open, but not a word came forth. She fidgeted,
and a blush suffused her many freckles, clothing
them from sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, what do you want?” encouraged Phœbe
again. “Please. Just say it right out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Th’ Judge,”—with not a movement of the lips.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe stared. She understood. Uncle Bob,
reigning over the local Juvenile Court, looked after
children exclusively. Here, helpless, homely, and
pathetic, was one of his charges. “Have you been
a bad child?” she asked sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then what—what have you been?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“L-l-licked!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” Phœbe went to her, taking one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>red hands, and drew her to a chair. “You poor
little girl! Here! Sit down. Now tell me. Who
licked you?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pale eyes became suddenly alive with fear.
The drooping mouth tightened, and trembled.
“Step-mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” cried Phœbe again. “You—so you’ve got
a step!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uh-huh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe sat down and regarded her visitor, marveling
at her. A step-mother—a cruel step-mother
who beat and tortured, exactly like the step-mothers
in the movies! “Then you’re Manila Botts,” she
declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Somehow, Phœbe, hearing the name from Miss
Ruth, had thought of Manila Botts as some one
tall and plump—quite a grown person. And here—!
“Tell me about your step-mother,” she bade.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s a woman,” ventured Manila, helplessly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And she’s married to my father—but she don’t
like him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know.” Phœbe nodded sadly. “They sit at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the table, and don’t speak, and don’t kiss each other
good-night.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she spends all Paw’s money,” went on Manila.
“And she hits me. Look!” She drew up a
loose sleeve. There on the thin arm was a dark
welt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe gasped.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila, pleased with the effect she had produced,
warmed to further details. “She hits me with a
piece of harness. It’s half of a tug. And once
she hurt me so bad that I went to Court.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But doesn’t your daddy help you?” demanded
Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nope. Just boozes.” She lowered the sleeve
resignedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe gave a quick look around. Then, “It’s
almost like a picture I once saw:” she said; “Her
Terrible Sin. There was a woman in it who got
whipped by a man who was tipsy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Gosh!” breathed Manila. “And what’ll you do
if <i>you</i> get a step?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe sat back. “<i>Me?</i>” she demanded, and
swallowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Phœbe said nothing. She felt her heart swelling;
her ears sang. She wanted to take hold of
Manila and pound at her with a fist. She hated
her! She hated——!</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie came in. “The Judge is in the lib’ry,
Manila,” she said, somewhat reprovingly. As Manila
rose, Sophie took her by a shoulder and led
her hallward.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe stayed where she was. A storm
was raging in her breast. Sophie had suggested
a step-father, and Phœbe had been able to laugh.
Did she not know Mother?—dear, beautiful, devoted
Mother, who would no more think of doing
anything that could hurt her small daughter than
of—than of—well, committing the most awful
crime: murder, or stealing, or setting some house
on fire. Why, who would think of giving the matter
of a step-father even a second thought? Besides,
the “movies” never pictured wicked, cruel
step-fathers. There were, probably, step-fathers
in existence. Even so, whoever heard of their
being undesirable?</p>

<p class='c008'>But this was different. Soon that father so dear
to Phœbe would be entirely free—it was Mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>who was setting him free. (And this gave Phœbe
at once a sense of her mother’s generosity.) Once
free——!</p>

<p class='c008'>“O-o-oh!” she gasped, and covered her face.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Her father—hers! And some woman!</i></p>

<p class='c008'>It hurt Phœbe cruelly. And the pain was a double
one. For she suffered on her own account, imagining
a nebulous figure intrude itself between
her and the father she loved with such a feeling
of absolute possession; and she suffered for her
mother. A strange woman in that mother’s place!—in
that dear New York nest, at the dainty, round
table in the cosy dining-room, in Mother’s corner
of the davenport before the open fire of the little
drawing-room! The pictures that Manila’s foreboding
called up succeeded one another upon her
mind’s eye as if it were the screen of a moving-picture
theatre.</p>

<p class='c008'>That was it! She understood all that Manila’s
suggestion might mean because she knew step-mothers
so well! Yes, she could even remember certain
ones in the movies, though not clearly. One
fact she was sure of: <i>All</i> step-mothers were cruel!</p>

<p class='c008'>Miserable as she was, she did not think of seeking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>her father, of telling him what she feared, and
how hurt she was. She felt angry toward him; she
resented the way he was acting! Why should he
think of another wife? And Mother away out
there alone!</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe went up to her room. Facing this new,
threatening trouble, she wanted seclusion. But not
seclusion to weep. Her eyes were dry, and her
head was up. This was a thing that called for action—action!
She must <i>do</i> something! She must!
And what?</p>

<p class='c008'><i>She</i> knew! Standing in the middle of the room,
talking to herself under her breath, suddenly it came
to her. She would thwart any plan of her father’s
to marry again! Did not people always thwart
other people’s plans in the moving-pictures? Well,
then, <i>she</i> would thwart.</p>

<p class='c008'>From that hour forward she began to watch her
father, secretly, jealously. And she discovered
things about him that made her uneasy. Why did
he always have that far-away look in his eyes?
Why did he keep his lips shut so tight, with that
knotting in the jaws that told her how hard his
teeth were set together? Why did he walk the
dull red carpet of Grandma’s sitting-room so often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>and so nervously? She had seen “movie” heroes
act like that. <i>Were all these signs that Daddy was
in love?</i></p>

<p class='c008'>She made up her mind to hunt Manila, and ask
her just how <i>her</i> father had acted before he married
that awful step-mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile, seeing these things which at least
conveyed worry, she came to forget herself in concern
over her father. He was unhappy. Yet not
about Mother, for it was clear that he did not care
for Mother. Then of course he was suffering about
someone else. She must try to distract his thoughts
to herself. She would redouble her tenderness toward
him. She would spend more time with him,
kiss him oftener.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the days that immediately followed, there
came into her face and voice and manner a sweet
concern toward him. She took to little attentions,
such as finding his hat for him when he left the
house, or hanging it up when he came in; she
lighted his cigarettes; she searched for bits of lint,
or small lengths of thread, on his coat. In other
words, young and slim-legged as she was,—a baby
still in most ways—she yet was assuming toward
her father the rôle of little mother: she was yearning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>over him. Oh, her Daddy! Her dear, dear
Daddy!</p>

<p class='c008'>After a time, her worry about him lessened
somewhat. Few women came to the house, and
these were mostly elderly. And her father went
out scarcely at all—never in the evenings. If he
and she walked together, he often met women whom
he knew, and bowed to them, smiling. If he seemed
inclined to stop for a chat, Phœbe was quick to urge
him on—first of all because she would not let herself
be cordial to anyone in the town, and, second,
because any woman might be <i>the</i> woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>But her father never cared to linger when she
pulled a little at his arm. Hopefully she had to
admit that he did not seem to like any particular
person.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then one day real fear came to her—with a
definite object for her jealousy. By chance she and
her father stopped at the drug-store down the street—the
drug-store to which she loved to hop and skip,
the while she nonchalantly bounced the rubber ball.
This day when she called for her ice-cream soda,
the pretty young woman came forward as usual to
wait on her. The pretty young woman seemed to
know Phœbe’s father well—very well indeed—almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>too well! She smiled across the counter at
him: she said, “How are you?” familiarly: she
even called him “Jim”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe ate her ice-cream soda with a troubled
heart. Her father did not eat anything. He talked
with the pretty young woman. And the latter urged
more ice-cream upon Phœbe when the tall glass was
half empty. That aroused Phœbe’s suspicions. She
declined a second helping. She understood the purpose
behind a second helping! “She wants to get
in with me,” Phœbe thought. “That’s because she
likes Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She left some of her soda in order to get him
out of the store and away. And she came to hate
the drug-store young woman. Once at the table
she made fun of her—of her teeth. Her father
said nothing, even seemed not to hear. Grandma
said “Darling!” reprovingly. But Phœbe cared
nothing about the reproof. There was something
at stake—something terribly important. She determined
never to go near that drug-store again.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was more than mere thwarting; already the
budding woman was plotting against a rival!</p>

<p class='c008'>Next, she made a practice, when her father went
down town, to go with him as far as that drug-store
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and see him well past it! And when she
had kissed him good-bye at some corner, she returned
with no glance toward that counter which
had always yielded such generous sodas and sundaes.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day Phœbe got a fright. The drug-store
young woman ran out to them, to intercept them.
Doctor Blair, she said, wanted to speak to Phœbe’s
father on the drug-store telephone. Phœbe was
forced to accompany her father into the place. But
she went warily, and she declined to have a soda.
She came away with fear. And when she was
home once more she wrote her father a note.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Dear Daddy</i>,” it ran, “<i>I don’t like the girl at the
drug-store. You know what I mean. I hate her, I
hate her, I hate her. Her grammar is bad. She
says don’t instead of doesn’t, like Sophie. Darling,
darling Daddy.</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>She did not give him the note. It was fortunate
that she did not. For the very next day, as she
came homeward after seeing her father safe beyond
that dangerous corner, here came the object
of her hate. The girl was pushing before her a
white perambulator. In the carriage was a big
rosy baby.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Phœbe would have passed girl and baby without
a look. But the former halted her. “Oh, Phœbe,
you’ve never seen my little son,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe halted, wide of eyes and mouth. Son?
That meant marriage—a husband!</p>

<p class='c008'>“My mother-in-law takes care of him,” explained
the drug-store girl. (But of course she was a girl
no longer. She was a grown woman—if she was
married and had a baby.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“He’s nice,” said Phœbe; “—like you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>After that she often went with her father to
have ice-cream sodas at the drug-store. And always,
in his hearing, she asked after the baby and
after the baby’s father, and she rather prided herself
on having carried out this particular case of
thwarting very well indeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>But with the young drug-store woman out of the
way, she still had no peace of mind. For now
there rose up in her day-dreams the vision of a
wholly imaginary step-mother. The visionary figure
was no longer nebulous. And it was forbidding.
Friends of her own age, school-life, even the sympathetic
companionship of a woman she could have
trusted, would have driven the vision from her
thoughts. But in that adult household, where all of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>her little confidences were given to no one, her morbidity
grew until the figure she had imagined came
to seem to be alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>It met her at quick, dim turns in the big lower
hall, or on the dark stair-landing. It lurked in her
clothes-closet, usurping the place of the Other
Thing, which now disappeared. Worst of all, she
could imagine the figure in her father’s room!</p>

<p class='c008'>Curiously enough, it bore no likeness to any of
the screen step-mothers Phœbe had seen. This
imaginary step-mother was tall, bony, heavy-shouldered
and long-armed, with sullen eyes and graying
brown hair combed straight back to show a wrinkled
brow. What the rest of the face was like, Phœbe
never imagined. It was always the brow and the
eyes that caught her fleet glance as she hurried by.</p>

<p class='c008'>That her father would scarcely choose such a
woman to be his second wife, somehow never occurred
to Phœbe. Had not Botts, poor liquor-soddened,
but kindly, soul, acquired Mrs. Botts when
unquestionably he did not want her? Such things
happened to widowers and divorced men. They
were matrimonially helpless. And the vision that
Phœbe’s fear called up was of all things formidable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and overbearing, yet silent—with the silence that
means power.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe trembled when she thought of her, and
at those certain dim places where the figure met
her she felt an awful prickling of the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face grew gaunt. Her nose seemed pinched.
Her cheeks lost some of their color. So that Uncle
Bob talked about a tonic.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe did not want a tonic. “Mother doesn’t
believe in medicine for children,” she declared.
“She’d like it better if I didn’t take any. Wouldn’t
she, Daddy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father looked at her keenly. Then he tucked
her under his arm. “I want a talk with my baby,”
he declared. They went into Grandma’s room together.
And no one followed them. Evidently her
father had something very particular to say.</p>

<p class='c008'>He had. For when he was seated, he drew her to
him, and looked up into her face—anxiously! “I’ve
got something important to tell you,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“About Mother?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“N-n-ot exactly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As he looked away, plainly embarrassed, a great
fear came to her. What Manila had said was coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>true—and he was about to confess it! A step-mother!</p>

<p class='c008'>She longed then to kneel beside him, to beg him
to promise her that he would never marry, to tell
him she could not bear it. But she held back.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, it’s just that I have to take quite a trip,”
her father went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“West?” she cried. She turned his face. Her
eyes were shining.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To South America—Peru,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh.” She backed a little, trying to adjust herself
to the news. Once she had seen him go on such
trips with little or no concern. Now the thought
of his leaving hurt keenly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I sha’n’t be gone long,” he said comfortingly.
And kissed her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy,—while you’re gone—may I go West?
To Mother?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m afraid—not—just right away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But if you go—to tell Mother good-bye.” She
was pressing the point. For one thing she wanted
to know before he went the truth from him about
the divorce.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I—I sha’n’t be going.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Her eyes stared into his. “Daddy! You and
Mother <i>are</i> divorced!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!” he gasped, plainly astounded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Did</i> you steal me away from Mother?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Has someone told you that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head. “Oh, my little girl!” he said
sadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy! It isn’t true!” Now she knelt, looking
up at him, imploring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All your life, Phœbe,” he began, “I’ve kept one
thought in front of me always: your happiness. I
want you to believe that——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whatever I’ve done—even if it doesn’t turn out
right—remember that I never considered myself,
only my daughter. I brought you here, where you
miss your Mother, when I knew your little heart
would ache. Oh, Phœbe,”—he bent toward her
lovingly—“you used to notice, didn’t you, that in
New York, when Daddy left the apartment, he
kissed only you good-bye?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“And for a long time you haven’t seen Daddy
and Mother go anywhere together.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy,” she whispered, with a quick look beyond
him, lest she be overheard, “don’t you like my
mother?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, Phœbe!” He shook his head again, sighing.
“Ah, if I could only spare my little girl!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy!” she cried, her arms suddenly about
him. “Dear, dear Daddy!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe, you must try to understand,” he counseled;
“and take it all just like the little woman you
are. Then you and I will decide what’s best—nobody
else. It’s your happiness I’ll think of—just
you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt now that she was to hear the truth.
She was ready to confide in him all her fears of
a step-mother—even her jealousy; ready to say if,
above all things, he wanted her happiness, then he
could give her that by putting no new wife in her
mother’s place.</p>

<p class='c008'>But her father got no further with what he
plainly intended to say to her. And Phœbe was
not able to open her young heart to him. For their
conference was broken in upon by Sophie, who entered,
smiling, telegram in hand.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Boy wants a’ answer, Mr. Jim,” she announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe’s father took the yellow envelope with a
trace of irritation at being interrupted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Daddy, is it from Mother?” Phœbe questioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>He did not answer. The telegram was open in
his hand. He was reading it, and his hand was
shaking.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait!” he bade, as Sophie turned to go.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is it?—Oh, Daddy!” pleaded Phœbe. She saw
with alarm that his face had gone suddenly white.</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose, crushing the wire and thrusting it into
a pocket “Where is my mother?” he asked the
girl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the dinin’-room.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In obedience to his gesture, Sophie went out.
He turned to Phœbe. “I must see Uncle Bob,” he
said quietly. Then, leaning to lift her to her feet,
“And you go into the garden for a little while, till
Daddy wants you.” He kissed her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe asked no other question. She was used
to mystery, to being bewildered. But she knew
something had happened—something out of the
ordinary. It was no business telegram that could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>drive the color from her father’s face and set his
fingers to trembling. As she walked over the lawn
she reflected that, after all, everyday life very closely
resembled the “movies”.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was Grandma who came for Phœbe. And
the latter saw that there was no smile on the kind
old face, and that Grandma’s head was shaking very
hard. Hand in hand, silently, the two went into
the library.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle John was there, leaning against the mantel.
Though his look was lowered, Phœbe knew
that he was angry. Uncle Bob stood nearby, hands
in pockets. He nodded Phœbe a greeting. Phœbe’s
father was not there. And Phœbe wondered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Little old dumpling,” said Uncle Bob. She came
to him, and he looked down at her with a tender
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” There was more curiosity than concern
in her voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A telegram has just come from—from Nevada,”
went on Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her face lighted. Up came her hands, to reach
toward him joyously. “Mother!” she breathed.</p>

<p class='c008'>He shook his head. “The telegram is from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Doctor,” he answered. “Your mother is—is pretty
sick. She has asked your daddy to come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!—but—but you think Mother will get well?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course she will,” declared Uncle Bob stoutly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next moment, here came Phœbe’s father, a
suit-case in one hand, his hat in the other. Behind
him was Sophie, carrying his overcoat. He
said nothing, only put down the suit-case, crossed
to Phœbe, and took her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>She lifted a beaming face to his. “Oh, Daddy,”
she said tremulously. “Now I know you and
Mother are <i>not</i> divorced!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He smiled at her. The others moved—started,
rather. Phœbe saw them and heard them, and realized
that she had shocked. She reddened.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My little Phœbe!” said her father, tenderly.</p>

<p class='c008'>She strove to explain herself, to lessen the bad
effect she felt she had made on the others. “I knew
you weren’t,” she apologized. “I didn’t believe it,
Daddy. I’m sorry I said it to you!—Oh, Daddy,
take me with you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her father turned to his mother. But it was Dr.
Blair who spoke. “No, Jim!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you think, Bob?” asked Phœbe’s
father.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Uncle Bob shrugged. “How can I judge Helen’s
feelings?” he answered, with a trace of bitterness.
“I have no child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I understand you, Bob,” retorted his eldest
brother, angrily. “But you know”—significantly—“there
are occasions not proper for a child.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe did not understand what Uncle John
meant. Evidently her father did; furthermore, it
seemed to decide him. “Give me a message for
Mother,” he said to Phœbe, and drew her to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>She took her disappointment bravely. “Tell her
I love her, Daddy. And tell her to come back to
me.” Then, imploringly, “Oh, promise you’ll bring
my mother back!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will bring her back, darling,” he promised.
“When Mother is better, we’ll all try to be happy
again—for your sake.” He kissed her, turned,
kissed his mother, took up the suit-case, and was
gone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob followed. In one hand he had a roll
of bills that Uncle John had given him; with the
other he searched a trouser pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the door shut behind Uncle Bob, Phœbe
sat down, not helplessly, but she felt a trifle weak,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>as if some sort of a prop had been taken out from
under her.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her Uncle John was suddenly anxious. “Now,
you won’t cry, will you, my child?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cry?” she repeated, with a touch of pride. “Oh,
no. I’m just saying to myself, over and over,
‘Daddy isn’t divorced from my mother. And he’ll
bring her back! He’ll bring her back!’ That makes
me so happy.” She gulped. Tears swam in the
gray-blue eyes, but she smiled through them. The
happiest thought of all she could not mention:
that she might now dismiss forever the possibility
of having a step-mother! She would have her own
mother again, and the dear New York home, and
her father, and Sally, the maid, yes, and the goldfish,
and—the “movies”! “I—I wish I had my old
doll,” she added, aloud, but as if to herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your doll, darling?” questioned Grandma.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Isn’t our little woman pretty big for a doll?”—this
from Uncle John.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s just—I—I want something to—to hold, and
love,” Phœbe explained.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Won’t you come to me, darling?” asked
Grandma.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m—all right,” Phœbe declared reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Uncle John loves you, Phœbe,”—it was Uncle
John again, and he was actually referring to himself
in precisely the way that Uncle Bob and her father
always did. “Uncle John never had a little girl,
so his love goes out to you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you,” said Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob had come in while his brother was
speaking. He grinned at Phœbe across the room.
“How about the fat old Judge?” he demanded. “Is
he any comfort?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded vigorously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, we all love you, dear,” quavered Grandma.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” acknowledged Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you love anybody but Daddy and
Mother?” asked Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I thought so! Grandma, and Uncle John, and
a wee bit of love for yours truly——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I love Miss Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob sobered. He looked down, thoughtfully.
“Miss Ruth,” he repeated. “Ah, yes. Who
doesn’t love Miss Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Manila loves her,” confided Phœbe. “Sophie
told me all about it. Miss Ruth has been so good
to Manila. She calls Miss Ruth ‘Angel’.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“But you—why, you hardly know Miss Ruth.”
There was a strange expression on Uncle Bob’s
face. He was looking at Phœbe, but he seemed to
be thinking of something far away. “Why do you
love her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe put her head on one side. “I don’t exactly
know why,” she admitted. In her heart, she
knew this was not strictly true. There was a reason
for liking Miss Ruth. It had to do with
Phœbe’s jealousy about a step-mother. Phœbe had
noticed that of all the women whom her father
knew, Miss Ruth, alone, never stopped when he
met her, to smile and make herself agreeable, but
only bowed pleasantly and passed on. In other
words, Phœbe had no reason to fear Miss Ruth.
“She’s nice,” she supplemented now. “And I—I
just do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand,” said Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a moment of silence then, of constrained
silence. Phœbe felt that constraint, and
glanced at her grandmother—just in time to see a
finger lifted in warning at Uncle John, and a shake
of the head that was intentional.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe wondered if something was wrong about
Miss Ruth. She made up her mind to ask Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>She thought of Sophie because the girl had just
entered, abruptly. She had a yellow envelope in
her hand. “Here’s another telegram, Judge,” she
announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe rose. “Mother?” she asked, as Uncle Bob
tore at the envelope.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bob!” said Grandma. She laid an anxious hand
on his arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the near distance sounded the long-drawn
whistle of a train.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen!” said Uncle John.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Read the wire,” urged Grandma. “Quick! We
can telephone the depot.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob shook his head. “No, Mother,” he
answered. “If this is from Helen, no matter what
it says it’s best that Jim should go.” He spread the
telegram out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Afterwards, for the rest of her life, Phœbe was
destined never to forget that minute, or the hours
and the days that immediately followed. For the
minute was to bring a great crisis into her life, and
the hours and the days were to be filled with sorrow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob read the wire. He took, Phœbe
thought, a good while to read it. And he made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>curious face at it, a grimace that seemed half comical,
half sad. Then he handed the paper to Grandma,
and turned to lean on the high, leather-covered
back of the couch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grandma read the telegram and—let it slip from
her fingers to the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ordinarily Phœbe would have sprung to pick up
anything that Grandma might drop. What held
her back now? She could not have forced herself
even to touch that rectangle of paper! She only
stared down at it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Precious little girl,” faltered Grandma. She
sank to a chair—feebly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What——?” began Phœbe. “My—my mother——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” said Uncle John, more tenderly than
he had ever spoken to her in all the past months.
“Phœbe, your mother is—in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe understood. The blood went out of her
face. Something drove through her body from head
to foot, like a stroke of lightning. But though she
swayed a little, she kept her foothold. Hers was
a staunch little soul.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She’s all Blair,” Uncle Bob had once said of
her. Now as she set her teeth together, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>clenched her fingers on her palms, she was taking
her blow in true Blair fashion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob came round to the front of the couch.
That big, moon-like face of his was working as he,
too, strove for control. He sat down, and held out
his arms. “Phœbe!” he whispered. “Little, little
Phœbe!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She lifted a hand to her face, brushed at a
cheek, tried to straighten, swallowed—then made toward
him unsteadily, and stumbled against his
breast.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe knew a great deal about death. Had she
not seen it thousands of times on the screen, and
in nearly every conceivable form?—by fire and water,
by famine, by the knife of the assassin, the
cup of the poisoner, the burglar’s automatic, the
soldier’s bayonet. Comfortably seated beside her
mother or Sally, before a great curtain that sprang
into life as the theatre darkened, she had even
watched the waging of the Great War!</p>

<p class='c008'>So it was easy for her, with her imagination thus
trained and stimulated, to call up—once she knew
of her mother’s death—such pictures in her mind
as could augment to the point of torture the natural
grief of her fourteen years. She saw her mother
die alone, weeping out her last moments; or she saw
a nurse and a priest watching beside that distant
bed. She saw other things that made her shudder,
and cover her eyes, or cling to whomever was nearest
for the comfort and sympathy that could drive
away such terrible visions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>That first week was a week of poignant suffering.
She was not left alone one moment. By day she
was passed, as it were, from hand to hand in the
household, taking her turn with Sophie in the
kitchen of a morning, spending the early afternoon
with Grandma, the later hours with Uncle Bob. By
night she slept only if someone sat beside her, in her
high, big room, and held her hand. Sometimes
Grandma stayed the first half of the night, or
Sophie. After midnight it was Uncle Bob who
took his place at her pillow.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was something particularly sweet and comforting
to Phœbe about that companionship through
the night. If she started from troubled dreams,
and cried out, always there was an answering voice,
low and loving, to soothe her; and there were tender
kisses, and in the dark a hand would caress her
cheek or smooth her hair. Then she would murmur
a little, brokenly, and sleep again.</p>

<p class='c008'>She found that a bereavement was not without
its compensations! For one thing, the local newspapers
had short, but kind, notices of the death, in
the Far West, of Mrs. James Blair. And there were
references to “the little daughter, Phœbe, now residing
with her grandmother, Mrs. John G. Blair”.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Never before had Phœbe seen her own name in
print. She liked the notices. They made her cry,
but they also interested her strangely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there were the black bands which Grandma
sewed on the left sleeves of Phœbe’s Sunday and
second-best dresses. Uncle John had opposed the
bands strongly, and in Phœbe’s presence. He did
not approve of the wearing of mourning by children.
But Uncle Bob thought otherwise. “It’s the
least we can do,” he said firmly. Grandma agreed.
Sophie thought a black band was “awful swell”.
And as for Phœbe, a band on her sleeve seemed to
set her apart, somehow, to single her out particularly.
And she liked to wear it. She was almost
proud of it!</p>

<p class='c008'>There were other compensations. People sent
her flowers, and candy, and Miss Simpson wrote
her a note of condolence—a most polite note, which
Phœbe tore up! And there was another letter, a
“Round Robin” from eight of the girls at Miss
Simpson’s. Phœbe was so happy when it came—happy
in a triumphant way. This letter she also
destroyed. And she refused to answer either.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They didn’t like me when my mother was alive,”
she declared. “And they said things about Mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Good for you, old dumpling!” commended Uncle
Bob. “There’s spunk for you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t encourage Phœbe in that sort of thing!”
begged Uncle John.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They’re a lot of hypocrites,” declared his
brother. “And this youngster’s got sense enough
to know it. Why didn’t they show some sympathy
over the other thing?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“True,” agreed Uncle John. “For that was worse
than death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Exactly. But now, they begin their writing.
They were thinking of themselves when they—when
I took Phœbe away from there. And now whom
are they thinking about?—that Simpson woman’s
pocket-book! Confound them!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe gave some reflection to that short passage
between her uncles. What was worse than
death? She knew: scandal!</p>

<p class='c008'>But the most gratifying thing that happened to
her was a surprise. One night she wakened to
find her hand in the clasp of a hand smaller than
Uncle Bob’s, softer than Sophie’s, firmer than
Grandma’s. And without being told who it was,
she instantly guessed. “Miss Ruth!” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“It is Miss Ruth, Phœbe,” came the whisper
back. Velvet lips touched her forehead and her
hair. An arm went round her, to pat the slender
shoulders and tuck in the covers.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I love you,” sighed Phœbe, contented, and slept
again.</p>

<p class='c008'>After that Miss Ruth continued to come. Often
in the darkness, if Phœbe was wakeful, Miss Ruth
would tell her stories—wonderful stories, about
princesses and knights, goblins and dwarfs and
fairies. These were all new to Phœbe, who knew
best the more modern stories of the films.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why didn’t you ever come to see us before?”
Phœbe wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You like me, don’t you, dear?” Miss Ruth returned
happily. It was early morning, and Phœbe
had just wakened. Already the room was lightening
with the dawn. Miss Ruth leaned down and
cupped Phœbe’s cheek in the palm of a hand. “And
you’re like your father,” she added with a tender
smile.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soon there came a time when Phœbe slept
through the nights without waking, when watchers
were no longer needed beside her bed. She
did not understand how it was, but she had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>to feel two things: First, it did not seem true
that her mother was dead, and having had no letters
from her mother since leaving New York, there
was not even the cutting off of messages to bring
home to Phœbe her loss; second, her mother’s death
settled finally a question that had vexed Phœbe
sorely, the troublesome question of what was going
to happen once the divorce was granted. Now
Phœbe knew. She had only Daddy! She would
go with Daddy.</p>

<p class='c008'>And as this fact was borne in upon her, she
remembered the matter that Manila had broached.
She recollected, too, the decision she herself had
made—to thwart. “And I must get at it,” she declared.
“Because now, with Mother gone it’s
likely——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She wrote her father. From Nevada he had
gone on directly southward, and his address was
such a very strange one that Phœbe had her Uncle
Bob direct her envelope. But no one saw what
she wrote. Though what she wrote was not what
she had fully intended to say. At first she had determined
to tell him frankly that she could never,
never bear to have a step-mother, who would hate
her, and beat her with part of a tug, and turn her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>father against her. She ended by sending him four
cheerful, newsy pages; only at the end did she
allow herself to touch remotely upon what was uppermost
in her mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Darling Daddy</i>,” ran her final paragraph, “<i>you
don’t like anybody but me, do you? Oh, dear
Daddy, say you don’t.</i>”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the letter was gone (she posted it herself),
she realized that now, with Mother dead, it would
be harder than ever for her if her father were to
marry a second time. She saw that she must have
counsel from someone. And who knew more about
the whole thing than Manila? She determined to
see Manila.</p>

<p class='c008'>During those first weeks following Phœbe’s arrival
from New York, how anxious the family had
been that she should meet and talk to no one. But
now, as during Phœbe’s attendance at Miss Simpson’s,
her uncles and her grandmother were more
than anxious that she should have company—and
plenty of it, so that her thoughts would not dwell
too much upon her loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aren’t there some little girls that you’d like to
have come?” Grandma often wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>This gave Phœbe her opportunity! “I’d like to
see Manila,” she announced one day.</p>

<p class='c008'>And so it came about that Manila paid Phœbe
a second visit, and the two went out to the summerhouse,
taking along Phœbe’s old doll, and Phœbe
told Manila all about Mother, and wept, her head
on Manila’s knee, and confessed her fears and her
intention to thwart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila was practical. “Well, if he comes back
with a Peru wife you can’t do nothin’,” she argued.
(So monosyllabic as a rule, Manila, when it came to
the subject of step-mothers, could be even talkative!)
“But if he comes back alone, why——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” asked Phœbe. “Because if he went to
the movies, he’d <i>know</i> step-mothers are bad. But
he doesn’t. And I can’t think how to show him. I
just can’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know.” Manila nodded solemnly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We’ll show him <i>mine</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Manila!” Phœbe was overjoyed. “That’s a
wonderful plan! Daddy’ll see her, and he’ll hate
her. But how can you get him to see her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila laughed. “Easy!” she declared. “I’ll
fix it so’s she’ll foller me here.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Phœbe looked at her with awe—and respect.
“Suppose she was to try to kill you!” she ventured.
“Step-mothers are awful bad in the movies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Let her kill me,” answered Manila, philosophically.
“Then the Judge’d have her hung.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say, what does your step-mother look like?”
Phœbe wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila thought. “She’s like a rat most,” she concluded
finally. “She’s slim, and she goes around
so’s you don’t hear her comin’. She has black eyes,
and slick hair, and a sniffy nose.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ugh!” breathed Phœbe. (After that the imaginary
step-mother that lurked in the big Blair
house whenever the light was dim, took on a ratlike
personality—slenderness, stealthiness, small
black eyes and sniffy nose.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe visualized the lady under discussion.
“The Hanging of the Rat-Woman,” she mused.
“That would be a wonderful title.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila thought so too.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I was a big cat,” she confided, “I’d wait
behind somethin’, and when Mrs. Botts come by,
I’d jump at her, and break her back.” Manila’s
face was pale with the thrill of it, and with hate.
Phœbe regarded her more respectfully than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“I run away today,” went on Manila. “I don’t
never ask Mrs. Botts what I can do, and Paw was
downtown. Miss Ruth telephoned, and when she
said you wanted to see me, over I come.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But when you get home—?” It was Phœbe’s
time to go white.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila’s eyes narrowed. “If she licks me, I’ll tell
the Judge on her,” she threatened. “And he’ll have
her in Court, and shame her like he did once before.
And a lickin’ don’t hurt long.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila waited about that afternoon long past the
time when, in the natural order of events, Phœbe
thought her visitor should have gone. For suppertime
approached, and yet Manila lingered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you afraid?” Phœbe wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uh-uh,” denied Manila. “I’m waitin’ till I’m
sure Paw is back. If Mrs. Botts licks me I want
him to see. Then I yell hard, and the folks on
either side call Paw up on the phone.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Manila went, Phœbe experienced real terror.
At the supper-table, not being able to eat, she
confided her fears to Grandma and her uncles.
Whereupon Uncle Bob promptly called the Botts
home up on the telephone. Mrs. Botts answered.
She seemed as quiet as possible, he said.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“But she’ll bide her time, the vixen!” he added.
“And Manila oughtn’t to leave home like that. I
have my hands full enough as it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe said nothing. What if he knew that she
and Manila had planned, when the time should be
ripe, so to tantalize Mrs. Botts that the latter would
invade the Blair house, there to serve to Phœbe’s
father as a horrible example of a real step-mother?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just let the mean old thing keep away from
here,” said Phœbe, by way of tactfully turning
Uncle Bob from even a suspicion of that plan.</p>

<p class='c008'>“My dear niece!” chided Uncle John.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At once lessons were resumed, filling the morning
hours of each week-day. And a strict program
of driving was followed out each afternoon
that the weather permitted. In consequence of which
Phœbe had little time to herself, and none for Manila.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They don’t want me to have even one friend,”
Phœbe concluded resentfully. “And Uncle John
wants me to forget Mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was leading Phœbe from chapter to chapter
of “A Child’s History of England,” each chapter,
to her mind, being dryer and more tiresome than
the last. She determined that no one should make
her forget her mother, and lengthened her prayers,
therefore, saying the first one reverently to God,
but always, the portrait before her, making her final,
and longer one, to her mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also she spoke to Uncle Bob about the History.
“It doesn’t seem like anything for a child,” she complained.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“Pretty dry—after the movies?” he suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe assented. “I’m used to something exciting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I understand,” he said gently. “But, little old
dumpling, later on, when you’re older, you’ll be
mighty sorry if you don’t read all these things. The
movies are all right—as entertainment. They’re
like the dessert at the end of dinner. But don’t
fail to know about the substantial things. The day
is past when girls need only to be pretty and fluffy.
We don’t want fluffy women, either. Great things
have just happened on this earth. You must know
about them, and you must know about the things
that went before them. Uncle Bob wants you to
be fine, and good, and wise, and womanly, like—like
Miss Ruth, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe remembered that she wanted to ask Sophie
about Miss Ruth. Sophie had afternoons off; not
Thursday afternoons, like Sally, but occasional
ones, when, in her very best coat-suit, with a hat
upon which were brick-red plumes, she set forth
to shop, or make calls or see a matinée.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe, going promptly to find and question her,
found her descending the back stairs, drawing on,
as she went, white gloves that were half a size too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>small. Her face was shining from a vigorous soaping,
as well as with expectancy. Phœbe joined her,
and went as far as the gate, bouncing the rubber
ball on the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sophie, what’s a probation officer?” she wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s a party that keeps a’ eye on another party,”
Sophie declared; “to see if they’re behavin’. Miss
Ruth Shepard is one. Your Uncle Bob tells her
who to watch, and it’s always some kid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe looked back at the house, and lowered her
voice confidentially. “Why did Uncle Bob say he
wished Miss Ruth lived at our house?” she asked.
“He said he’d been saying she ought to for years
and years and years.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At first Sophie did not answer. But when they
reached the gate, past which Phœbe was not to go,
Sophie put it between them, then turned to lean
upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I tell you, you’ll tell,” she charged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Cross my heart to die!” vowed Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, y’ see, the fact is the Judge just worships
Miss Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“O-o-oh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, he’s in love with her.—Now, don’t you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>dare say I told you, because I’d lose my job.—But
he’s been in love with her since before you was
born.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t blame him,” declared Phœbe. “She’s
dear, and she’s pretty. And I love her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A strange look came into Sophie’s eyes—a
searching look. “Say! You let everybody see you
love her, will y’?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course! Because I do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You show your grammaw how y’ feel, and your
uncles, and also your papa.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because Miss Ruth is good,” Sophie went on.
She was oddly grave, for some reason. “Don’t
forget that, Phœbe. She’s the nicest woman in this
town. But—she’s never been happy.” Sophie
sighed. “Things’ve never gone right for Miss Ruth,
some way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And she doesn’t love Uncle Bob?” persisted
Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie drew back. “You know all you oughta
know about it,” she said, laughing. “Now run
home, dearie, to Grammaw.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Bob isn’t handsome,” conceded Phœbe.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“He’s too short, and he’s bald, and a little old,
too——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Ruth ain’t a girl no more,” reminded
Sophie. “She looks awful young. But she was
nineteen the year your daddy got married, and so
she must be about thirty-three or so.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My!” marveled Phœbe. “I thought she was
twenty-five, maybe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bein’ a probation officer don’t take it out of
you like housework,” reminded Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she doesn’t <i>hate</i> Uncle Bob, does she?” went
on Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Naw! Don’t they see each other every day at
the Court House?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But she doesn’t come here any more. Why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Far down the street a man could be seen, slowly
approaching. “Well, I’ve got to be trottin’,” said
Sophie, fixing her hair and giving a touch to hat
and dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If Uncle Bob likes her, and I like her, and you
like her,” argued Phœbe, “why doesn’t she come?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe she’s tired at night. You know she
works all day.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She sat up with me after—Mother died. She
wasn’t tired then.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Well, now, I’ll tell you what’s the matter. Everybody
in town knows it, anyway. But you didn’t
hear it from me, mind y’, if you happen to let it
out——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll remember.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your Uncle Bob loves Miss Ruth, and he’d
marry her if certain things wasn’t a fact.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What things?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never mind. But this much I can tell y’: Miss
Ruth don’t love your Uncle Bob, and she’ll never
marry him, for the plain and simple reason that
she loves somebody else.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!—Who, Sophie?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Somebody that went and married somebody
else,” Sophie answered glumly. “And so Miss
Ruth stayed single. And folks say her heart is
broke——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just like in the moving-pictures, Sophie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Only it’s a lot harder when it’s real, and not
make-believe.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some day maybe that man’ll get free and come
back to Miss Ruth,” suggested Phœbe. “And then
she’ll marry him, and they’ll be happy for the rest
of their lives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No.” Sophie shook her head with finality. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>won’t end that way. You see, the man Miss Ruth
loves has got a brother that also happens to be in
love with her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My, what a lot of gentlemen love Miss Ruth,”
marveled Phœbe. “Doesn’t that make three?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe. But the trouble is that the one brother
just won’t ever take her from the other brother, and
so neither’ll marry her. And I’m afraid the picture’s
goin’ to end sad.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She started away. And presently Phœbe, watching,
saw Sophie meet that man who had been slowly
approaching in the distance. The man turned with
Sophie, and the two disappeared down the long,
tree-shaded street. The man, then, was Sophie’s
beau!</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe turned houseward. The world was just
full, she reflected, of good moving-pictures that no
one seemed to be using.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>To Phœbe, Uncle Bob took on a new and intense
interest. Heretofore, he had been just Uncle
Bob, stout and jolly and loving, with certain unknown
duties at the Court House, and his various
homely pastimes at home, such as gardening and
puttering about the stable, and hunting worms. But
now all at once he seemed different. And Phœbe
forgot his stoutness and his baldness in remembering
that he was the adoring, yet unhappy, lover.
And just as she had watched her father’s face for
signs of suffering, she now watched this uncle,
discovering sadness in his smiling blue eyes, and
yearning even in his whistled tunes as he hammered
away at the chicken-coop.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He loves Miss Ruth,” she pondered. She was
doubly tender to him, knowing his secret. And
just as she had vowed to thwart any plan of her
father’s to marry a second wife, she now gave time
to a plot that would bring Miss Ruth to Grandma’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie discouraged the idea. “You can’t make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Miss Ruth love your Uncle if she don’t,” she asserted.
“And—she don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m going to pray about it,” resolved Phœbe,
stoutly.</p>

<p class='c008'>It meant a new ending to her bedside devotions.
First there was that general plea to her Maker,
which, she felt, kept her right in her own conscience
and in the sight of her fellow-beings. Next came
her whispered appeal to her mother, bringing that
dear presence poignantly near. The final prayer
was as simple as it was heartfelt: “Oh, God, please
help Miss Ruth to love my Uncle Bob!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet she never dared broach the matter to her
uncle. Other things they discussed most confidentially;
for instance, Uncle John.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When I get educated,” Phœbe wanted to know,
“like Uncle John is, will I talk to people like he
does, and make them sleepy?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob roared with laughter, and slapped his
knee. “That’s a good one!” he cried. “And down
at the Court House, sometimes when I talk a good
deal <i>I</i> can put a lawyer to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lawyers are not nice people,” Phœbe declared.
“At least they’re never very nice on the screen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She asked him quite frankly about her program
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of work. “Public school is out, and so is Miss
Simpson’s,” she reminded him; “and here I am at
lessons every morning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ll be just so much ahead of everybody else,”
returned Uncle Bob. “And why waste the time?
Pile up the good work while Daddy’s gone. Now!
now! What’s that? A little tear?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe nodded. “Lately, when I shut my eyes,
I can’t see Daddy’s face any more. He seems such
a long way off. Just see where Peru is on the
map!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know, darling. It’s hard.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked around—to make sure they were
alone. “If—if I only had my mother,” she whispered.
“Uncle Bob, are there a lot of girls in the
world without mothers?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded. “Too many.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sometimes it seems as if I can’t stand it,” she
confessed. “My throat twists up,—right here—and
it aches. I wake in the night, and I pretend that
she’s close to me——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe she is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No; because I hold out my arms.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob drew her close. “Ah, you’re lonely!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“I want my mother,” whispered Phœbe. “Oh,
Uncle Bob, I want my mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“There! There!” he comforted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She died out there alone! Did you all hate her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! No!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did my mother do that was so bad?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He made her stand in front of him. “Phœbe,”
he began solemnly, “shall I tell you the truth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want to know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And if I tell you the truth, you’ll never worry
about it again?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, I won’t, Uncle Bob.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The truth is this:”—looking at her squarely—“your
mother just <i>couldn’t</i> do wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I love you,” faltered Phœbe, glad and grateful
and on the verge of tears—all at the same time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I could only give you back your mother!”
went on Uncle Bob, huskily. “To make you happy,
there isn’t anything I wouldn’t do—not anything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His big chin rested upon his tie. He lost himself
in thought, his eyes on the carpet,—they were
in the library—his arm about Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then she was reminded all at once of that
which could make him happy. For Sophie burst
in, her over-curled hair lifting with the speed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>her coming, and her eyes dancing with something
like mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Shepard’s callin’, Judge,” she announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” Uncle Bob sprang up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss Ruth!” cried Phœbe, joyously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ask Miss Shepard in here, Sophie,” bade Uncle
Bob. Then, as Sophie swung herself out, “You
love Miss Ruth very much, don’t you, Phœbe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Phœbe. And then, before she
could stop the words, for she was thinking aloud,
“So do you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wha-a-at?” exclaimed Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“People say so,” defended Phœbe, a little frightened
at her own temerity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob’s face grew suddenly stern. “That’s
gossip,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He strode to Uncle John’s table and back; then,
“That’s all right, old dumpling. Now you go in
to Grandma. And remember that Uncle Bob’s
going to try to do something that’ll make his dear
Phœbe happy. He’s going to try right away—soon—today.
For he’s got a plan—a wonderful
plan——”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Miss Ruth who cut him short. She entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>quickly, a little out of breath. And she was
pale. “Judge, I’m sorry to trouble you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You never trouble me.” How deep Uncle Bob’s
voice could be! Phœbe was standing beside Miss
Ruth, her hand in a firm, cool, loving clasp. She
watched her uncle narrowly, seeing that what
Sophie had told her was true.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Judge, it’s Manila,” announced Miss Ruth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s wrong?” asked Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mr. Botts is drinking again. And so—well,
you know my neighbor on the other side? She’s
very close to the Botts’s. And they’ve got that
child locked up, in a room on this side——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe drew away from Miss Ruth, and stared
up at her. “In prison!” she murmured. Here
was another drama, more startling even than this
one which concerned Miss Ruth and Uncle Bob’s
unrequited love.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth was appealing to Uncle Bob. “My
neighbors can hear Manila crying—they heard her
in the night, and this morning, too, while it was
still dark. Oh, Judge, they say there’s no bed in
that room——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob straightened determinedly. “We’ve
got to take that child,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Oh, I’m so glad to hear you say that!” cried
Miss Ruth. “Poor, unhappy——”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe heard no more. For an idea had
come to her, and she had decided to act upon it.
Manila was locked up by her cruel step-mother—exactly
like some unfortunate waif in a moving-picture
story! Uncle Bob meant that Manila should
be set free.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I’m going to do it,” vowed Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>She made for the hall door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>All the moving-picture heroines that Phœbe
loved were responsible for her resolve to rescue
Manila. The plan seemed an inspiration; and not
in the least degree blameworthy—on the contrary.
When had she seen one of her screen favorites do
anything, however startling, that had brought disaster,
or punishment—even displeasure? Quite
naturally, therefore, Phœbe apprehended only success
in her venture, happiness for Manila, and praise
for herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>She thrilled with the excitement of the venture
as she set off from the Blair side-porch. Here was
a real heart drama!</p>

<p class='c008'>As she trotted across the lawn and through the
garden, Phœbe made up her mind as to how she
would carry out her design. Once, in a book she
had read, a boy had stealthily attracted the attention
of another boy by throwing pebbles against a
window. She determined to throw pebbles against
Manila’s window.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>She knew which was the Botts house by beginning
at the Shepard residence and counting three.
Manila’s home was of brick, with white trimmings
and green blinds. The window toward Miss Ruth’s
was not high from the ground, and it was just
above a recently spaded flower-bed. When Phœbe
reached the fence that skirted the flower-bed, she
gathered a handful of small gravel, tossed it against
the window-panes, and then crouched in the lee of
the fence. Her heart was pounding against her
middy blouse—pounding wildly. She was glad of
it. In a matter of this kind that was precisely what
a moving-picture heroine’s heart should do!</p>

<p class='c008'>More small gravel. Then a face appeared at
the window—Manila’s face. And Manila’s pale
eyes looked out, and roved inquiringly. But only
for a moment. She had something in her hands—a
pair of scissors; also some paper. She was busy
with these.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe felt disappointment. Manila was not living
up to expectations, to the possibilities of the
drama. She should have come flinging against the
glass, glad and thankful of a rescuer. Her face
should have been very wan, and tear-stained. Her
hair should have been free about her shoulders.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>There should have been a long purple welt across
one poor, pitiful cheek.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead, Manila’s hair was braided, but very
mussy. It stood up around her forehead like a
fiery fringe. Phœbe was reminded of savage girls
that she had seen at the showing of the Roosevelt
South American pictures.</p>

<p class='c008'>“St! St!” she hissed. She stood up, but stooped.
She was determined that she, at least, would do <i>her</i>
share toward carrying out the whole thing properly,
to make it like a real picture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila saw her, and hoisted the window.
“Hullo,” she greeted, with one eye on the work in
her hands. “What’re you doin’ out there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Manila Botts,” cried Phœbe, crossly, “I have
come to save you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila, hanging upon the window-sill, thrust out
her under lip rebelliously. “But I’m cutting paper
dolls,” she protested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Manila Botts!” scolded Phœbe, with a stamp
of her foot. “Uncle Bob means to take you away
from your step-mother, and I’ve come to get you.
Now, are you going to act like this?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Patiently Manila dropped scissors and paper.
Then she disposed herself sidewise, face down, upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>the sill, let one leg drop over it leisurely, next, another,
and slipped quietly to the ground. A moment
later Phœbe drew her through a gap in the
fence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila seemed not only indifferent, but even reluctant,
about being rescued. As for gratitude,
there was not a trace of it. As the two made off
together along the tradesmen’s dirt road that ran
behind the row of houses, she pointed out now one
thing, and now another, in a way that made Phœbe
more irritated than ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But haven’t you been locked up?” Phœbe
wanted to know; “and in a room without a bed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aw, well,” returned Manila, philosophically,
“you betcha I wouldn’t let Mrs. Botts know I
cared.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the rear gate leading to the Blair house
was reached, Manila began to hang back. “Wisht
I didn’t come,” she declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wha-a-at?” Phœbe stopped short.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m scairt,” confided Manila.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Scared nothing!” Phœbe said stoutly, slamming
the gate behind them. “You’re with us now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Botts told me, ‘Don’t you budge’.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“You don’t have to mind her any more. After
this you mind just me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She won’t let me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“She can’t help herself. Because I’m going to
adopt you. You’re going to be—let me see! I
don’t know which, my sister or my daughter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila halted and pulled back. “Phœbe, she’ll
come after me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you worry. I’ve seen lots worse than
her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Worse’n</i> her?” repeated Manila, incredulous.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the pictures. And I’ve noticed that the hero
or the heroine always comes out ahead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila allowed herself to be led across the rear
lawn toward the Blair house, but she was not convinced.
“This ain’t no movie,” she reminded.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s better than a movie,” asserted Phœbe, “because
it’s honest-to-goodness true!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila looked back over a shoulder. Her concern
was growing fast. “But what if she seen us
run away?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was turning a corner on her way to the
library windows. The library windows were low
of sill. At this season of the year they were wide
open. Of course all the outer doors of the house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>were open, too,—at least they were not locked.
But Phœbe had no intention of entering her home
in any prosaic fashion. No, indeed. Heroines of
the screen always made their exits and entrances
romantically. She meant to carry out this drama
in true moving-picture fashion.</p>

<p class='c008'>She lowered her voice. “Who cares?” she demanded
scornfully. “It was all just perfect. There
was the window, and the ladder——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ladder?” challenged Manila.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, what was better, you threw yourself out.
You are the prisoner, Manila, and I’m the heroine.—My,
if only somebody could’ve come by with a
kodak!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They crept along by the wall. Manila was
sniffing. Phœbe eyed her approvingly. This was
better—the proper spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sh! Sh!” cautioned Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>They arrived, bent over, under a window.
Phœbe slowly straightened and spied out the
ground. The library was empty. Good! She gave
a hop, landed on mid-torso across the sill, gave a
wriggle, and stood safely within. “Now!” she
whispered cautiously, putting forth a hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila was weeping in good earnest. “She told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>me, ‘Don’t you budge’.” But she took Phœbe’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the two were side by side once more,
Phœbe was all tender sympathy. She felt that
Manila was really acting very well. At first the
latter had given the impression that, after all, Mrs.
Botts was not so bad as she had been painted. But
of course she was! And this drama was promising
excitement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila sought the nearest chair. “Wa-a-ah,”
she wept.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Poor little girl!” said Phœbe, stroking the red
hair. “If only we had our mothers—both of us.
Manila, do you suppose our mothers are together
in Heaven?” Then with a glance at the woebegone
figure, “Well, perhaps not exactly together,
but close by. Perhaps my mother is in a mansion
all of precious stones, and your mother—your
mother is walking along the streets of gold.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila cast up one eye, the other being hidden
under a damp fist. “How do y’know?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle John tells me,” condescended Phœbe.
“Uncle John’s a clergyman, and he knows all about
Heaven. ‘The twelve gates of the City are twelve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>pearls,’ he says. Oh, Manila, if you and I could
only go to Heaven to our mothers!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila stood up. “Where <i>is</i> Heaven?” she
asked hopefully, as one who is of a mind to set off
forthwith.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Where? Well, I don’t know exactly. That’s
one thing I forgot to ask Uncle John.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila’s face fell. And her eyes, roving, lit
upon the nearby globe. She pointed. “Can’t y’
find it on the world?” she suggested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On <i>that</i>?” cried Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look for it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe gave Manila’s arm a soothing pat. Then
with a shake of the head, “Poor little girl, don’t
you know that Heaven isn’t on the globe? And
I’ve never even seen it in the movies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Manila sat down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know what’s inside,” confided Phœbe. “That’s
the bad place, where we go if we kill anybody,
and if we tell lies. It’s awful hot there, Uncle
John says, and we burn and burn. Oh, Uncle John
knows everything religious.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was something about all this that made
Manila’s courage sink, for once more she fell to
weeping.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Manila!” pleaded Phœbe. “Everybody says
that Heaven is—look!” She pointed ceiling-ward.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Up in your house?” faltered Manila.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! Somewhere in the sky.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do we get there? Airplanes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The minute you die, Manila, you’re an angel,
and you grow wings.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t wanta die!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe put her arms about the shaking figure.
“There! There!” she comforted. “What you
need is mothering. <i>I</i> know. It’s what I want when
I feel blue. Manila, I’m going to mother you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And then—! Up to now Phœbe had felt that
from the standpoint of drama there had been not
a little lacking in this rescue of an imprisoned stepdaughter.
She was to feel this no longer. For the
exciting now took place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe never did quite figure out how it happened.
But first there was a quick slamming of
doors, and a shrilling of voices—Sophie’s, Grandma’s,
and another, a strange woman’s. Then as
Manila leaped from Phœbe’s hold, the door opened
with a fling, so that the window-curtains billowed
and swung, and into the room, stamping and panting,
with eyes bulging and lips puffed out, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>very torrent of threatening cries, came the Rat-Woman!</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe knew her instantly, even before Manila
cried “Mrs. Botts!” And Phœbe faced her, bravely,
with dislike and reproof in her look. Crouched
behind her was Manila, sobbing wildly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So-o-o!” cried the Rat-Woman, advancing upon
Phœbe. “I find out if someone can come into my
house to steal!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob had entered behind her. He was
smiling, hands in pockets. “Nonsense!” he retorted.
“Who would steal Manila. You’ve been hard
on this poor child again, and she simply took to
her heels.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I tell her, ‘Don’t you budge’,” cried Mrs. Botts.
(Phœbe noted that there was an accent, slight,
but enough to give what Phœbe thought was the
perfect touch. This was no ordinary villain!)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” said Uncle Bob, mildly, “how does
Manila happen to be here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell! Yes!” added Mrs. Botts, wrathfully. “I
hear about this Phœbe. She is smart. She knows
everything.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe drew herself up. “Well, I know <i>one</i>
thing,” she returned coolly.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Ye-e-es! And what?” Mrs. Botts folded her
arms and hung her weight on one foot.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know that all step-mothers are cruel.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Out leaped Mrs. Botts’s arms. She swept around
upon the Judge. “You hear it?” she demanded.
“You hear it? She is permitted to insult me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not to be denied that Mrs. Botts was
doing her part to make the whole thing really dramatic.
Phœbe had to give her credit for that.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe?”—Uncle Bob was as mild as ever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe wished that she might have had a different
tale to tell. If only she had thought to gag
Manila, and tie her hands! If only she could tell
of, say, a kidnapping plot, of a great, black limousine,
and Mexicans with knives! But——</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Uncle Bob,” she began calmly, “I did
go over and get her. Miss Ruth told us she was
crying. Well, she wasn’t. She was cutting paper
dolls. Anyhow, I stole her, and she’s cried a lot
since. Uncle John says I’m too big for dolls, so
I intend to adopt her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Adopt her!” exploded Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, just look at her!” implored Phœbe. “She’s
had <i>such</i> bad luck!—a step-mother, and the awful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>name of Botts, and she’s red-haired, and freckled,
and she’s got adenoids!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Botts sprang forward. “So-o-o!” she answered.
“She is like that. But she can mind her
own business. And she does not talk too much.
She might be worse—as bad as you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” said Uncle Bob. He crossed to her,
anxiously Phœbe thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You are a little thief!” Mrs. Botts stuck a
fist close to Phœbe’s nose. “And I will have you
arrested! The whole town knows about you. Miss
Simpson, she——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob put a hand over each of Phœbe’s ears
then, shutting out that shrill voice. Once Phœbe
heard “school,” and twice she heard “your
mother.” Then Mrs. Botts flung herself away and
out.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What did she say, Uncle Bob?” asked Phœbe.
“What did you cover my ears for? What did she
say?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob did not reply. He was white with
rage. He went to the door and looked through.
“Sophie, put that vixen out!” he ordered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now that Mrs. Botts was gone, Manila was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>tearless once more. “My goodness!” she mourned,
“now we’ve done it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” asked Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, don’t y’ see? The Rat-Woman come too
soon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sure enough!” Phœbe agreed. “Oh, that’s too
bad!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And your paw don’t git to see her,” Manila
added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe, why did you want your daddy to see
her?” asked Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, just be-because,” Phœbe frowned at Manila,
warning her to silence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob sat down upon the couch. “Come
here, old dumpling,” he bade. And when Phœbe
had gone to him, “Now, because why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t want to tell you,” she confessed frankly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I’d really like to know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She hesitated. “If I tell you, you won’t laugh?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t laugh,” promised Uncle Bob, gravely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because I want Daddy to see how mean and
terrible step-mothers are,” explained Phœbe. “We
were going to show him Mrs. Botts. And now
the whole plot is spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“So you think step-mothers are mean and terrible,”
said Uncle Bob. And there was not even
a glimmer of a smile in his eyes. On the contrary—he
looked actually troubled!</p>

<p class='c008'>All that she had longed to say to her father now
surged to Phœbe’s lips. She dropped beside her
uncle, and clung to him. “Oh, I don’t want a step-mother!”
she cried. “Oh, Uncle Bob, help me!
Keep Daddy from getting married again! You
will, won’t you? A step-mother would whip me,
and wear Mother’s clothes, and make Daddy hate
me! Oh, Uncle Bob, you <i>don’t</i> think Daddy will
bring one home?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Darling baby,” he said tenderly, “I know your
Daddy won’t bring one home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, not a Peru woman!” pleaded Phœbe. “I
don’t want one!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you worry. No Peru woman is going to
get him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t want <i>any</i>body,” she persisted. “Oh,
Uncle Bob!”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was all. Except that when Phœbe had
gone to Miss Ruth’s with Manila, and was nearing
home again, Grandma came out to meet her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>And Grandma was particularly tender to her, for
some reason, and that very evening sat beside
Phœbe’s bed for a little while, and chatted.</p>

<p class='c008'>And from then on—Phœbe could not help but
notice it—Grandma seemed to take great interest
in Phœbe, to be with her often, to make her little
presents, and buy her little things, and say so
much to her that was sweet. For which reason
Phœbe came to understand Grandma better, and
daily their love for each other grew.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t tell anything by the way a day
starts,” philosophized Phœbe, as she unlaced her
shoes preparatory to going to bed; “because a wonderful
day starts exactly like an ordinary one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The day had indeed started ordinarily enough—with
the usual routine: breakfast, twenty minutes
in the open air, then an hour equally divided between
spelling and sums. Next Uncle John
“heard” the spelling, and looked over the sums;
after which, settling himself in a big, comfortable
chair by a window,—his back to Phœbe—he listened
while she read aloud from Dickens’s
“Child’s History of England.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe liked the reading aloud best. Because
she had discovered that if she would read quietly,
and in one tone, Uncle John could be counted upon
to fall asleep during the first ten minutes. Whereupon
Phœbe, with “Little Women” handy, or “Sara
Crewe,” or, better still, something by “The Duchess”,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>was able to change from the History to a story
without in any way disturbing Uncle John.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Uncle John was finished with his after-breakfast
sleep (Sophie confided to Phœbe that it
was his liver), he invariably wakened with a start,
pretending that he had not been dozing at all, said
“Yes, yes, yes,” as he got up, and “Very well, dear
child,” as he crossed to the table and his work, and
Phœbe was then at liberty either to go on reading
from the book of her choice or betake herself elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this was to be a wonderful day. For no
sooner was Phœbe engrossed in her book, as her
clergyman uncle was in his sermon, than Sophie appeared,
looking flushed and important. She made
toward the big table with a swish of her starched
skirts. She bent to whisper something. Whereat
Dr. Blair sprang up with a joyful exclamation and
strode out.</p>

<p class='c008'>It so happened that Phœbe was reading “Airy,
Fairy Lillian”. On Sophie’s entrance she had
quickly closed that fascinating volume and slipped
it between her back and the chair, then folded her
hands thoughtfully in her lap; not that she feared
to let Sophie know what she was reading—as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>matter of fact it was Sophie who had recommended
“The Duchess” books, and pointed out the
place of their hiding. But Phœbe knew that whenever
Uncle John was roused out of the strange,
dazed—almost cataleptic!—condition into which he
fell when he worked, he was more likely than not
to take stock of everything about him. And
Phœbe did not care to have him see “Airy, Fairy
Lillian”.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle John gone, Sophie did a hop-skip to
Phœbe’s chair. “What d’ y’ think!” she exclaimed
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe looked up languidly. Secretly she was
annoyed at Sophie’s interruption, for the exquisite
<i>Lillian</i> (a sort of novelized Marguerite Clark) had
just sprained her slender, silken-covered ankle, and
a lover fully as handsome as Dustin Farnum was
about to take <i>Lillian</i> up in his strong young arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” she inquired politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie bent, put a hand on each knee, and beamed
into Phœbe’s eyes. “Comp’ny,” she announced.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Company? Who?” Phœbe was more than interested.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Genevieve Finnegan.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Phœbe made a wry face. “Her!” she said, and
flushed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I pretended I didn’t know her,” chuckled
Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was suspicious. “What do you think
she’s come for?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can’t say.” Sophie straightened and shrugged.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Maybe she’s going to tell me they’re all sorry
for putting me out of school,” suggested Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re right! Because Miss Simpson come
with her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Miss—Simpson!” gasped Phœbe, staring.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the sittin’-room with Grammaw and Dr.
Blair.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe stood up. The bow on the front of her
middy-blouse rose and fell. Her eyes swam. It
was all very well to be independent, to say she did
not want friends or acquaintances. But she had
lived through scores of dull days—days that were
all the harder to endure because she was a product
of a metropolis. She had not even seen as
much of Manila as she would have liked. Miss
Ruth, too, came only when she had to. And when
Uncle Bob had suggested asking little girls in,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Phœbe had proudly said no—but said it with a
bursting heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>But now the time was come when she could
stand out against her loneliness no longer. “Oh,
Sophie! Sophie!” she cried, clasping her hands.
“It’s just splendid! No more tutoring with Uncle
John! Oh, how I hate it! No more Dickens’s
‘Child’s History of England,’ or these awful classics!
Miss Simpson’s come to ask me——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She paused. It was the look on Sophie’s face
that made her pause. Resentment was written
large on that countenance framed by the tousled
hair. Phœbe understood the resentment. She
shared it. “But she didn’t want me when my
mother was—West,” she said.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie’s arms were folded. “Now, you’re talkin’!”
she replied admiringly. “When you <i>needed</i>
these fine ladies, they didn’t stand by y’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe nodded. “I know. I’ve thought about it
lots since my mother died. And I know there was
something the matter.” She looked down at the
carpet, restraining herself from questioning Sophie.
What was it that Mrs. Botts had said—while Uncle
Bob covered Phœbe’s ears? Something very ugly,
Phœbe was sure. And Phœbe would have liked to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>ask now, yet shrank as ever from discussing her
mother with a servant. But Uncle Bob had said
that Mother could not do wrong——</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sophie!” she whispered. “<i>I</i> hadn’t done anything,
had I? And Miss Simpson sent home my
books!” Her voice broke. She sank to the chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” said Sophie, gently. Then to rouse
her, “Keep your chin up, Kiddie! Don’t you let
that Finnegan girl see that you care!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t care,” protested Phœbe, with spirit.
“You just watch me! Go on—bring her in. I’m
ready!” She caught up a volume of Scott from
where she had deposited it when <i>Lillian</i> had proved
the more enthralling.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ha-ha-a-a-a!” chortled Sophie, proudly. With
a toss of her head, she went out.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe opened her book at random. Perhaps it
was even upside down—she scarcely knew. However
it was, she became intensely engrossed in it, so
that she did not even glance up when the door to the
hall opened and Sophie returned.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I found her, Miss Finnegan,” announced
Sophie, in her best receiving manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!” gushed Miss Finnegan. She burst past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Sophie. “Phœbe! You <i>darling</i>! Oh, I’m so glad
to see you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe let her book drop, still open, to her knees.
Very carefully she put one forefinger on the line
she was supposed to be reading. Then she raised
eyes that had in them mild surprise, and just a
trace of sweet bewilderment.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh! How do you do,” she answered politely;
and got up. “Please excuse me. I—I get so interested
in my books. This is ‘Kenilworth,’ by Sir
Walter Scott. Of course you’ve read it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Kenilworth’?” said Genevieve. “Why, no.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You haven’t?” returned Phœbe, shocked. “Oh,
my, that’s too bad. After a while, when you’re
grown up, you’ll wish you’d read it. A girl can’t
be just fluffy. And a woman mustn’t be fluffy. We
must know things, and we must be wise and—and
as much like Miss Ruth Shepard as we can possibly
be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve blinked, trying to comprehend this onrush
of ideas.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe put her head on one side and smiled.
“Oh, I <i>do</i> so enjoy the classics,” she declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Genevieve’s turn to be bewildered. “The—classics?”
she echoed. “What are the classics?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Phœbe knit her brows. “Why, they’re—they’re—well,
just the most important thing. My Uncle
John says ‘The classics are the foundation of culture’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that so!” pondered Genevieve. “Well, I’d
better put ’em down. What did you call ’em?
‘Kenilworth’?” She drew a handsome leather notebook
from the richly embroidered handbag on her
arm. “Because Mamma says, ‘Germans or no Germans,
with our name we just got to have culture’.”
She touched her tongue with the tip of a slender
gold pencil and wrote.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie, backed against the hall door, shook with
silent laughter. As Phœbe glanced her way,
roguishly, Sophie noiselessly applauded, and signalled
Phœbe to continue her tactics.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe assumed the grand air. “I suppose you’ve
heard about my father?” she began again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In Peru, ain’t he—isn’t he?” asked Genevieve.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s South America,” said Phœbe. “Only a few
people ever go there. Daddy is such a wonderful
mining-engineer that they just had to have him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve put away her notes. “Well, I suppose
now, the first thing you know, your father’ll
be getting married.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Phœbe turned white. All the grand air went,
leaving her staring almost wildly. “Married!” she
breathed. “My—father——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve smiled with gratification. Her shot
had gone home. “Mamma says,” she went on
blandly, “that since this war, with so many men
killed off, why, a man that ain’t—I should say isn’t—married
don’t stand a chance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe flung “Kenilworth” down. “Oh, but he
wouldn’t!” she cried. “No! I don’t want to lose
him!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie was at her side in an instant. “Darlin’,
don’t you believe it! He loves you, and just nobody
else.” Then marching up to Genevieve, angrily,
with hands on hips, “Say! What did you
come here today for, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve lifted her shoulders with disdain.
“Mamma says,” she returned calmly, “that you can
tell whether people are nice or not by their servants.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Y’ can!” taunted Sophie. “Well, ‘Mammaw’
sure oughta know. Because Bridget Finnegan was
oncet a servant.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve’s face darkened. Her neck appeared
to swell. “Well, I can tell you this much,” she answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>hotly. “There are some things my mother
<i>wasn’t</i>. People have never said that she——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Here!” stormed Sophie. She caught Genevieve
by a shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sophie!” gasped Phœbe, appalled.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Sophie did not hear. “Now, you run along,”
she ordered, showing Genevieve toward the door.
“Do y’ understand?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve went haughtily. “I wouldn’t stay for
anything,” she declared. “I’ll wait for Miss Simpson
in my motor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“When y’ got your motor,” sneered Sophie,
“what a <i>pity</i> y’ didn’t get some manners!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Genevieve ignored her. “Good-bye, Phœbe,” she
said, from the door. “I don’t believe us Simpson
girls will see you again at school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’m dead sure you won’t!” cried Sophie, and
slammed the door in Genevieve’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe sighed. “Now, she’ll make Miss Simpson
hate me,” she said sadly. “And so will all the
girls, and they won’t take me back——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take you back!” raged Sophie. “After they
sent you packin’ home that time? Where’s your
pride? If it was me, I just wouldn’t <i>go</i> back. And
your uncles and your paw won’t let y’ when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>hear what I tell ’em!—Phœbe, you show Miss Simpson
that you don’t want her old school. You turn
<i>her</i> down—first!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe rallied herself. She realized that Sophie
was speaking the truth. The quarrel with Genevieve—and
especially what Genevieve had just said
(Phœbe was aware of an inference there), made
her see that the last bridge was burned between
her and the Simpson School. So she might as well
show indifference to the visiting Principal, whose
voice, even now, could be heard from the direction
of the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right, Sophie,” she whispered bravely.
“Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She caught up “Kenilworth” once more, tucked
herself into a corner of the big couch, rested her
head in a scholarly pose upon one hand, and lost
herself between the pages of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Darling Phœbe,” gushed Miss Simpson, “how
do you do!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How do you do,” responded Phœbe, rising politely.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s so <i>nice</i> to see you again,” went on the Principal.
“Oh, my dear, we’ve missed you so much!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such straight looking out of those frank eyes,
and such cool poise, was most disconcerting. Miss
Simpson, with a smile that was wholly muscular,
changed the subject by bending down to
Phœbe’s book. “‘Kenilworth’?” she cried in delighted
surprise. “Do you enjoy it, Phœbe?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I love it,” answered Phœbe, with quiet sincerity.
“Every day I read it with Uncle John—Sir
Walter Scott in twelve volumes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Simpson turned to Grandma, waiting and
smiling and nodding her white head at the far end
of the library table. “Dr. Blair must be such a
great help to Phœbe,” she declared.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Oh, he is.” Phœbe did not wait for Grandma.
“Uncle John is my tutor, and I like having a tutor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Simpson fell back a step, as at some new and
disconcerting thought. “Do you, dear?” she murmured,
and sank, still staring at Phœbe, to a convenient
chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do,” returned Phœbe. “You know princesses
always have governesses and tutors. I’ve seen them
in the movies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The movies!” exclaimed Miss Simpson.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Phœbe doesn’t go to them,” said Grandma,
quickly. “Dear Phœbe, you know you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe remembered what Sophie had said about
keeping one’s chin up. She raised hers now. “I
used to,” she reminded. “So I know. And Uncle
John and I are reading Dickens’s ‘Child’s History
of England’—it’s a wonderful book. Oh, we’ve got
a whole year’s work planned out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Simpson sat back, swallowed, glanced right
and left—then broke forth in a smile that was meant
to be warmly diplomatic. “I see,” she cooed.
“But I’ve come today, Phœbe, because—ah—er—I’m
calling on all of my pupils for the Fall term,
and so——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Up went Phœbe’s chin another inch. She returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the diplomatic smile. “But, Miss Simpson,”
she protested pleasantly, “I wouldn’t change my
tutor for anything. Uncle Bob says a tutor is ever
so much more stylish than a private school.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Simpson’s face set. She rose as if propelled
upward by a spring. “However,” she said
icily, “a private school might be of great value to
you. It might help to eradicate the effect of your
moving-picture training, and teach you that nice
little girls are never loquacious.” Now she revolved
toward Phœbe’s grandmother. “Where, I wonder,
is dear Genevieve?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Grandma,” said Phœbe, “Genevieve didn’t seem
to care a bit for this wonderful ‘Kenilworth’, so
she’s outside.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good afternoon, Mrs. Blair.” Miss Simpson
extended a long arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But you’ll have a cup of tea, won’t you, Miss
Simpson?”—Grandma was following her guest,
who was even now at the hall door. “The Judge
will be home, and he’ll be so glad to see you,
and——” Miss Simpson was already in the hall;
Grandma went with her, closing the door upon the
straight-standing, angry little figure at the middle
of the library floor.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>“Yes, have a cup of tea, Miss Simpson!” cried
Phœbe, wrathful. “The Judge’ll be home and he
<i>won’t</i> be glad to see you! You’ll take me back, now
that my mother’s dead! Well, you won’t! I’ll read
the classics first! Scott!”—she whirled “Kenilworth”
to the sofa—“And History! And anything!”
Whereat she flung herself bodily atop the book and
the sofa, buried her face in a cushion and wept.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!” It was Sophie, come to hear the results
of the Simpson visit. “Whatever is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe sat up. “Lots of things,” she declared.
“This house—it never gets any smaller. And
everybody grown up. And, oh, think of having
Uncle John six days of the week at home and
twice at church on Sunday!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie laughed. “Don’t blame y’,” she confided.
“But I hope you said No to her.” She jerked her
head toward the hall.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I did.” Phœbe got up. Rebellion flamed in
her cheeks. “But, Sophie, there’s one thing sure.
Something’s got to happen: Public school or the
movies!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Land sakes!” gasped Sophie. “Don’t you know
your folks’ll never let you go to public school?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“They won’t?” Phœbe went close to Sophie, and
lowered her voice. “Then it’s the movies,” she declared.
“I’m not going to stand things any more.
I’m going to see some pictures and I’m going with
you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe Blair!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My mother took me. It isn’t wrong.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the folks! If they ketch us——” Sophie
threw up both hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>“They won’t. They think I’m asleep at nine
o’clock. We can go just before that, and see a
picture when it’s on for the second time. We can
steal down the back stairs—I’ll carry my shoes.
Oh, Sophie, will you do it? Say Yes! I haven’t
seen a picture for months!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We-e-ell,”—Sophie was visibly weakening—“I
might. Because I think you’re kept in too close.
And that ain’t good for any kid.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I want to see just one more five-reeler!”
pleaded Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I take y’ just once?” Sophie held up a finger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe had won. She threw her arms about
Sophie, almost smothering her. “Darling Sophie!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Oh, Sophie, you’re a girl, and you understand!—Oh,
Sophie, who’s the star I’ll see tonight?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie half turned away. She raised ecstatic
eyes to the neighborhood of Uncle John’s Map of
Palestine. She sighed. “William S. Hart,” she
half whispered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“William S. Hart,” repeated Phœbe. She echoed
the sigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s grand!” breathed Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe touched Sophie with an anxious hand.
“What girl is playing with him now?” she asked
jealously.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t remember. But”—enviously—“she’s
awful pretty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Does he—like her?” went on Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, he’s crazy about her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mm!” Phœbe considered the toe of a shoe.
Now and again, in the case of this particular star,
she had dreamed dreams. She had looked forward
to a time when her hair would be up and her
dresses longer; then, if her plans worked out satisfactorily,
might <i>she</i> not be a moving-picture actress,
and play with her favorite hero?</p>

<p class='c008'>“When he told her how he loved her,” mused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Sophie, almost as if to herself, “and asked her to
be his bride——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe came back to sad realities. “How did
he ask her?” she wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She was settin’,” recounted Sophie. “He come
close, and looked at her. She dropped her eyes;
so he reached over and took her hand. Next, down
he went on one knee. ‘Dear little woman,’—that’s
what it read in print—‘let us ride into the sunset
together!’” Sophie gestured, indicating a possible
sunset.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But did she say Yes?” inquired Phœbe, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, not just at first. She kinda hung off——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Goodness!” exclaimed Phœbe, incredulous. She
walked to and fro, head down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But think of it! A gang of Indians come
scootin’ up to the Ranch. And he fought ’em all,
and saved her. So she took him, and he kissed
her——!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe paused. It seemed to her then as if she
were to be penned up forever in this small town
which she so hated; as if she would never grow
up, and be able to say what she would do; as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>other girls—this William S. Hart girl, for instance—simply
had everything. In an excess of resentment
she went up to Uncle John’s favorite armchair—and
kicked it!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Phœbe, dear,” cried Uncle John, “I am the
happiest of men!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was killing time—yet pleasantly, with the
aid of “Airy, Fairy Lillian.” She kept it boldly
in her lap as this more formidable of her uncles
paused beside her chair. She was not rebellious
now, but she was determined. Of course Uncle
John would be horrified if he were to know about
her plans for the coming evening. So he might
just as well be shocked not so completely by what
he would surely regard as a frivolous book. Well,
let him be shocked!</p>

<p class='c008'>But he did not look at the book. “Grandma has
just told me,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” encouraged Phœbe, anxious to return to
<i>Lillian</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, it has warmed my heart,” he declared;”—to
hear that you really like my teaching, and the
literature that we’ve enjoyed together. And that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>you’d rather stay with me than go back to Miss
Simpson’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I would.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blessed little student!” He said it lovingly.
And—wonder of wonders!—he leaned down and
kissed Phœbe’s hair!</p>

<p class='c008'>After he was gone, Phœbe sat for a long while,
thinking. Uncle John had been unusually kind and
tender to her—just at the wrong time! In all the
past months, when had he ever thought to do more
than give her an absent-minded pat? Why then was
he being so nice all at once, so that her conscience
hurt her?</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt resentment toward Uncle John.</p>

<p class='c008'>She considered, too, his hatred of the “movies”.
He had his church, in which he was supreme. He
could get up at stated intervals and talk as much
as he liked, and who dared interrupt him? He had
music, as well, and processions. And he was paid
for all this (Sophie declared him to be the best-paid
clergyman in town), when, so far as Phœbe
could see, he was thoroughly enjoying himself all
the time! Writing a sermon was not work. Making
calls on people was not work. It was all a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>weird, not-to-be-understood form of grown-up
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then why should he interfere in what <i>she</i> thought
was having a good time?</p>

<p class='c008'>“He sha’n’t,” she said firmly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other things happened that afternoon which
made Uncle John’s conduct seem part of a conspiracy.
For here came Grandma, bringing an apple-turnover.
Phœbe particularly liked apple-turnovers.
As she munched this one, letting the flakes
of a deliciously rich crust fall upon the pages of
“The Duchess”, she could not help but wonder if
Sophie had not, for some reason, confessed the plot
for that night, with the result that Grandma was
resorting to bribery!</p>

<p class='c008'>Next, Uncle Bob appeared. He had an oblong
box in one hand. The box was elaborately tied
with blue ribbon. It was chocolates, and they followed
the fate of the turnover. No one had a word
to say about supper, or Phœbe’s possible lack of
appetite for it. She ate, and she read her novel
openly. And—her conscience hurt more and more!</p>

<p class='c008'>But darkness, the love of adventure, and a thirst
for her favorite delight, helped her to feel indifference.
Sophie was on the back porch when Phœbe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>came stealing down. Not a word was spoken as
the latter sat on the bottom step to put on her
shoes. The stars were out, the air was soft. When
finally, hand in hand, they stole toward the back
gate, the perfume of Grandma’s flower-beds gave
place to the friendly odors of chicken-coop and
stable, and they knew they were safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now,” said Sophie triumphantly, as the gate
shut softly behind them.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s like a regular movie,” whispered Phœbe.
She danced up and down.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they reached the theatre, they went warily.
They waited in the foyer till the lights were lowered,
after which they fairly stole into their chairs,
in the last row. Here, shoulder to shoulder, with
an occasional anxious glance about them, they sat
through the program.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just before the end of the last picture, Sophie
touched Phœbe, motioning her to follow. They
sought the foyer once more, and saw the end of
the evening story from a position by the door.
Then as the audience rose, out the pair flew, heads
down, to the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe had not spoken while she was in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>theatre. Now and then she had looked up at
Sophie, or squeezed her arm gratefully. She was
afraid of attracting attention to herself. But out
in the open air she burst forth gaily. The gay
music, the accustomed entertainment she loved, the
excitement of again being part of a crowd, all combined
to make her feel that she was back once more
among the old, happy days. With Sally, she had
been free to come and go. She loved freedom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Something curious happened just after she and
Sophie left the theatre. At first, while they were
in the more crowded part of the town, Phœbe did
not notice anything—she was too busy chattering.
But when they were farther out toward the Blair
Addition, Phœbe realized that a man was walking
rather close behind them, crossing a street when
they crossed it, turning corners when they turned.
As they were nearly home the man suddenly came
abreast of them, and greeted Sophie. And he
seemed to be a very good friend of Sophie’s, for he
took her arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the rear gate, Phœbe went on a few steps
alone, and then halted to wait. She was not near
enough to catch what the man and Sophie said:
she could hear only the murmur of their voices.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>Overhead the stars were low and bright. The trees
swayed in the night wind. Yet Phœbe was not
thrilled. She did not feel that romance was in the
air—not romance such as “Airy, Fairy Lillian” held—not
by any means the kind of romance that she
had just enjoyed at the theatre. She wished only
that Sophie would not be silly, and would hurry
up. It was late. Phœbe dreaded the climb in the
dark to her room.</p>

<p class='c008'>But no feeling either of fear or remorse troubled
her as she prepared for bed. She had gained her
room without discovery. And as it would never
occur to any one of the family to suspect that she
might steal out of an evening, there was no reason
to fret about the next day. She said her prayers
hastily and sleepily. And she did not ask for
forgiveness because she had been to the moving-pictures.
They were her right. They rounded out
that all but perfect day that she exclaimed over
while she unlaced her shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two nights later, she and Sophie went again,
and again she saw the man. This time he summoned
enough courage to take a seat beside Sophie
in the theatre. And when the lights went down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>he held Sophie’s hand. That Phœbe did not like
at all. It was all right on the screen, of course—holding
hands. But with Sophie! And so close!
It did not seem nice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sally never acted like that,” Phœbe told herself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Also at the rear gate, as they were returning,
the man grew bolder. So did Sophie. From a considerate
distance, Phœbe saw the two embrace—saw
their faces touch.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that, Phœbe turned and walked away. She
was angered.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when Sophie joined her, giggling and whispering,
she made no comment. Only she resolved
that she would not go out at night with Sophie
again if the man was to accompany them home.
And before she lay down in the dark to sleep, she
said a little prayer about it, and promised that she
would not break her resolve.</p>

<p class='c008'>But a few nights later, a change of program
brought the moving-picture version of a play that
she had seen acted in New York by men and
women who spoke their lines. It was a temptation
too great to resist. “Just this once more,”
vowed Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>The vow was to be kept—so far as this particular
theatre, and this town, was concerned; but
not kept in the way Phœbe had meant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The picture was wonderful. She had so much
to tell Sophie—of the differences between the play
as it was flashed upon the cloth before them and
as it was on the speaking stage. She was joyous
and excited. When the man came, as before,
she was even glad, for it was nice to be able to
lean across Sophie and tell him about the differences.
No regret for having broken her resolve
troubled her.</p>

<p class='c008'>And then something happened—between Part I
and Part II of the picture, when the piano was going
merrily, and Phœbe was looking over the audience.
At first, she was conscious of a white face—a woman’s
face—turned her way. Next, with a sinking
of the heart, she knew the face—Mrs. Botts!</p>

<p class='c008'>She got up and turned in the other direction.
Sophie pulled at her dress, and said something.
Phœbe did not heed her. To get away, that was
her only thought. She fumbled for, and found,
her coat, and put on her hat. And with Sophie
trailing behind her as people rose to let them pass,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Phœbe led the way out of the theatre to the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mrs. Botts faced them. There was a cruel twist
to her thin mouth. Her eyes were dancing. Her
hands were on her hips. Her head was tipped sidewise.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So-o-o!” she triumphed. “This is the good
Phœbe! She comes to make trouble for neighbors.
But she goes out at night with servants. She is a
sneak!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe said nothing. She was too frightened,
too bewildered. She guessed what Mrs. Botts would
do, and was trying to think how to meet the inevitable.
But she looked at Mrs. Botts calmly
enough.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A little sneak!” repeated Mrs. Botts. “Pah!”
She snapped her fingers, threw back her head with
a laugh, and walked away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe said nothing. She took Sophie’s hand
and started home. The man, for once, did not join
them. Phœbe did not even think about him. She
was too miserable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie was also speechless, until, with an explosive
outburst, as they neared the back gate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>she fell to crying and talking at the same time.
Phœbe patted her arm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too bad,” she said. “You took me, and
now they’ll blame you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s done is done,” wept Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To think I did it while Daddy was away!” exclaimed
Phœbe. Suddenly she felt amazed at the
enormity of her own conduct. “How could I? Oh,
Sophie!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s just why y’ could,” retorted Sophie, with
a show of spirit. “Your maw’s gone, and your
papa’s away, and you’re heart-broke. So, instead
of lettin’ you cry your eyes out, I took you to the
movies, and helped y’ forget. But none of them
will understand.” She halted by the chicken-coop
to look up at the house, dimly outlined against the
sky.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe looked up too. Sophie’s last night! That
was her thought. Her only comfort was to be
taken from her. With new help at Grandma’s,
what kind of a place would it be?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Sophie,” she whispered, “let me go to
Grandma’s room right now, and tell her, and ask
her to forgive us both!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell! Oh, my goodness!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>“Or I’ll wake up Uncle Bob, Sophie! Oh, I
can’t stand it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you want me to be fired?”</p>

<p class='c008'>They walked on a little. Phœbe’s head was
down, her step lagged. She thought of Miss Ruth.
If she could only turn aside to the Shepard house,
standing white and temple-like in the starlight.
There, so close, was one who would understand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sophie began to whisper again: “Don’t peep,
darlin’. ’Cause we’re safe. I’ll watch the phone.
If Mrs. Botts calls up, I’ll know what to say. If
she writes, I’ll burn the letter. And if she dares
show her ugly face——!”</p>

<p class='c008'>They went up the back stairs like shadows.
Usually Sophie did not see Phœbe into the latter’s
room on late returnings from the theatre; but this
time she entered, put on the light, turned down the
bed, and said a fond good-night.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish I could tell somebody,” Phœbe insisted.
“Because I—I feel awfully bad. I think it’s my
conscience.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But Sophie shook her head. “If they find out
about us,” she argued, “just remember this: They
can’t fire <i>you</i>. So don’t you worry.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” answered Phœbe. But her face was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>pale with apprehension. “And, anyhow, I’ve seen
three wonderful five-reelers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But when she was alone, and the light was out,
she, too, broke down. “I deserve to be punished,”
she confessed. “I said I wouldn’t go again, and
I broke my word.” She dropped to her knees beside
the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>She prayed for her mother to ask God to take
her. “I’m discouraged,” she complained. “Oh,
Mother, I want to come to you. Everything I like
to do is bad in this house!” She recalled a day
when Uncle John had been most displeased with
her because, with an eye to harmonious color, she
had rearranged the books in the library, putting
the green-backed ones on one shelf, the red-backed
ones on another.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, so real was her contrition and her fear,
that not once as she knelt did it occur to her that
what she had done, and what she was suffering,
was in any way like a “movie”.</p>

<p class='c008'>She lay down at last, but with eyes wide and staring
into the dark. It was one thing to steal away
at night to the movies with Sophie, shoes in hand
till the back steps were gained, giggles restrained
till the rear gate was left behind, spirits high because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of what the theatre promised of dear delight,
the whole thing a thrilling adventure: it was another
matter to face out the escapade in the full
light of morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oh, the dread of it! For of course Mrs. Botts
would tell. Then, what? There would be bitter
blame on the part of Uncle John. He would blame
Sophie most (which was a comforting thought!).
But Sophie was grown. Sophie was free. Sophie
could be saucy, if she wanted to, and could pack
up, and leave, her earnings in her purse. But
Phœbe would have to stay; to face it out at the
table; to live it down in shame.</p>

<p class='c008'>“O-o-oh!” breathed Phœbe. She wrestled with
despair.</p>

<p class='c008'>A clock downstairs rang the hours until three.
Then, exhausted, she slept—and in her sleep fought
Mrs. Botts hand to hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she awoke, she was sitting up. Dawn was
at hand. She could tell that by the thin, white
horizontal lines of the shutters. She sprang out
of bed and began to dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once she had packed to run away. There was
no time to pack now. To go, that was her only
thought. She ran a comb through her hair. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>threw her serge coat over her arm, and took her
hat in her hand. Then with a hurried good-bye
kiss for her mother’s pictured face, she stole out
and down, bound for New York, and the dear apartment,
and faithful Sally.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a glorious morning. The sun was not up
yet, so the air was cool—even crisp; and Phœbe,
making her way quietly through the rear gate and
along that road used by the tradesmen, had to slip
on her coat. She halted a moment under some trees
that stood, occupying a whole lot, between the Blair
house and the railroad station. And as she settled
her coat, the birds called down at her. They were
just awaking!</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe had no thought of taking a train for New
York. In the first place, she had no money, having
spent her last penny at the theatre; in the second
place, the station-agent knew her, and would
report her departure. She did not even go near
the station. What she did was to take her direction
from it down the long macadam road that led,
straight and smooth, beside the double line of rails.</p>

<p class='c008'>That way lay New York! She would walk till
an automobile came by. Then she would ride as
far as possible, perhaps walk some more, sleep at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>pleasant farm-houses along the route, take up her
journey the following morning, and thus, by easy
stages, reach the loved city and Sally.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole plan seemed so feasible that as she
turned into the road at a point well south of the
station, she wondered why she had never thought of
it before. And it was so jolly, trotting along like
this! She felt free, and strong, and happy. And
very brave.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mother would want me to leave there,” she told
herself. “She never liked any of them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The sun came up. The birds began their morning
songs. Phœbe took off her coat, then her hat.
When she spied an automobile rushing toward her
from the distance, she went aside to crouch in the
deep, weed-grown ditch that stretched between the
wagon road and the track, covered her face with her
coat, stayed motionless for a few minutes—then
went merrily on.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was the first eluding of a car bound town-ward
that made her think how exciting this adventure
of hers was. And with that thought came
another—a wonderful one! It made her heart beat
fast. She fairly skipped. Tears of joy sprang to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>her eyes. She <i>would</i> be a moving-picture actress!
And act with William S. Hart!</p>

<p class='c008'>Why had she never thought of leaving before—to
carry out the plan?</p>

<p class='c008'>She was so happy over her determination that
she all but allowed herself to be seen by an automobile
that, with milk-cans rocking and clanking,
shot past on its way out of town. She was not
ready yet to ask for a ride. That would come later,
when a village to the south was at her back, and
the chances of her being recognized had lessened.
Just now, with her new idea in mind, she felt so
happy and light-footed that she needed no rides.
She knew she could go on walking all day!</p>

<p class='c008'>But there was something she had forgotten:
breakfast. Very soon she remembered it—at about
the time she was accustomed to having it. And as
she trotted along she thought of her cereal and
cream, her three-minute egg, and the little stack of
crisp, hot buttered toast that Sophie always brought
with the egg.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe looked on either hand for houses. She
had passed quite a few, but they were set so far
back from the highway that she had not feared
being seen from them. But if she was to have even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>a bite of breakfast, would it not be necessary to go
boldly up to one, and ring the bell, and ask for
food?</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” said Phœbe, aloud. “They’d telephone
straight into town. I’ll just have to stand it till I
get farther.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her trot changed to a trudge. The summer sun
climbed the sky, and the coolness went out of the
air. She grew thirsty, and forgot her hunger in
her desire for water. What made things harder
was the fact that automobiles or wagons were frequent
now, and she had to be on the lookout constantly,
and was constantly compelled to forsake
the road for the deep ditch while travellers went by.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then there were the trains—both freight and
passenger. She hid from them. From the north
they might carry people who would know that she
was missing; from the south they would take news
of a lone little girl walking toward New York.</p>

<p class='c008'>Toward noon she went aside into a clump of
trees to rest. Here she found water—a shallow,
unshaded pool of it. But it was not the kind she
had always been accustomed to, cold and limpid and
clean; it was warm, and a thin scum floated upon
its surface. Also, there were long-legged, nervous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>insects going about upon it jerkily. She had to
drive them away before she could drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once she had left the New York road, somehow
she did not want to return to it. She was afraid
of discovery. As noon came and passed, there were
more automobiles and wagons to elude, and even
more trains. Once she saw a man on foot, with
a dog at his heels. She remembered a moving-picture
she had once seen in which dogs had been used
to find a murderer. She wondered if the man and
the dog would not soon be hunting for her!</p>

<p class='c008'>At that she started off once more, going parallel
to track and road, but keeping well out of sight
from both. This meant hard work, for there was
cultivated land to cross, there were fences to climb,
and whenever a house loomed up ahead, it was
necessary for Phœbe to make what to her was a
heart-breaking detour.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the middle of the afternoon she was exhausted.
Ahead of her, in a field, she saw a hay-stack.
She was famished, and more thirsty than ever.
But her knees were failing her. Above all things
she needed rest. She crossed the field, sought the
shady side of the stack, gathered together a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>loose hay with which to make a bed, and dropped
upon it, her hat screening her face.</p>

<p class='c008'>She awoke with a start, knowing she was not
alone, and with a cry of fear scrambled to her feet.
A man was beside her—a young man with a very
brown face, and dark eyes that twinkled. He had
curly black hair, and wore a black slouch hat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hullo,” said the man, grinning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Goo-good-afternoon,” returned Phœbe, catching
up her hat as she backed away. She did not
like the looks of the man. He made her think of
gypsies.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What you doin’ out here?” went on the stranger.
He looked her over impudently.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe knew that she must give this man a satisfactory
answer. And she felt, she scarcely knew
why, that she must not let him think she was alone.
“My father has just gone over to that house,” she
answered, trying to keep her voice even. “I’m very
hungry, and my father has gone to get me something
to eat.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that so!” The man considered her explanation,
and even turned about to look toward the
house she had indicated. “Well, how does it happen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>your father and you are hangin’ around this
hay-field?” he persisted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,”—Phœbe saw that she had partly convinced
him—“my father’s automobile broke down,
over there on the road. But I had to have something
to eat before he fixed it, so he’s going to ask
for food over there, and for gasoline.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Say!” resumed the young man, dropping his
voice confidentially; “you stay here, and I’ll go
over and meet your father, and help him carry the
things—eh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“All right,” agreed Phœbe, heartily. (Anything
to get rid of the stranger!) “And tell my father
please to bring plenty of water.” (This was a
master stroke!)</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll bring it. Now, you set down, and I’ll be
back with water and grub in no time.” He gave
her a final look, then started off quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was plain that he only half believed her. He
was going to learn for himself whether or not
her father was at the farm-house. He was counting
on her hunger and thirst to hold her there in the
strip of shade while he was gone. Her instinct
told her that.</p>

<p class='c008'>It told her more. She knew she must get away.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>But not at once. The shady side of the stack did
not face toward the farm-house. Soon the man,
reaching the fence that skirted the yard, would be
out of sight of Phœbe were she to remain in the
shade, for a corner of the hay would hide her. She
waited.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently, peering around that corner, she saw
the man climb the fence. As he stepped on the
farther side, she stood boldly in sight. He looked
around toward her, and she swung her hat at him!</p>

<p class='c008'>He waved back, and turned away.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she ran—straight in the opposite direction,
and as hard as she could go. Terror gave her
strength, terror of she knew not what. She forgot
hunger and thirst and weariness: she thought
only of putting distance between herself and that
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her way led her back to the road. Even as she
set foot upon it, an automobile turned into it from
a side lane that ran at right angles to road and
track. The machine was a small, open car, driven
by an elderly man. Phœbe went to the middle of
the road and held up her hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He isn’t from town,” she argued. “Nobody’s
told him about me.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>The elderly man stopped. “Want a ride?” he
called down cheerily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Would you mind?” inquired Phœbe. “You see
I want to go to town, because my aunt, who’s
camping over here,”—she waved a hand in the direction
of the hay-stack—“feels sort of sick, and
wants some medicine.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Climb in,” was the hearty invitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe climbed. Then, calling upon her imagination,
and aided by moving-picture plots she could
recall, she told the elderly man all about herself and
her aunt, and how they came to be camping out behind
a hay-stack in a farmer’s field. And so real
was her story, and so genuine seemed her concern
for her aunt, that the elderly man was hugely interested,
and gave Phœbe some plums out of his
coat pocket.</p>

<p class='c008'>As they spun along, Phœbe fell to wondering
what she would do when they arrived in town.
For she feared the man would take her directly
to a drug-store, and there she would have to confess
that she had no money. Of course she could
say that, somehow, she had lost it. But suppose
the man not only bought the medicine she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>have to ask for, but insisted on carrying her back
to a point on the road nearest that stack!</p>

<p class='c008'>Worse! Suppose as they entered the little town
that an officer of the law hailed them, to ask if
Phœbe was not the little girl who had run away that
morning! And suppose——</p>

<p class='c008'>But to Phœbe’s intense relief none of the several
possibilities she feared came to pass. For the
reason that the man, when he reached the outskirts
of the town, came to a stop and explained that he
would have to turn aside for a mile or so, and
would not be able to take Phœbe all the way into
town.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just the same,” he added, “if you’ll be at this
spot an hour from now, I’ll pick you up as I start
home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, thank you!” exclaimed Phœbe, grateful.
But she was not thanking him for his offer. Her
gratitude was for the ride and for the almost
miraculous escape from being carried into town.
She climbed down, waved a good-bye, and watched
the little open car whirl away in a cloud of dust
down a long dirt road that led under a small bridge.</p>

<p class='c008'>That bridge gave her an idea. She had the plums,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>and she was too tired to go farther until she had
more rest and sleep. “I’ll hide,” she determined,
“and I’ll eat two of the plums, and then I’ll sleep.
And early tomorrow morning, I’ll go round this
town before anybody’s up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At one end of the bridge, and under it, where
the timbers met the earth, there was a little scooped-out
place, as if some one no larger than Phœbe had
been there before her and hollowed a resting place
for her. She crawled into it, lay on one side with
her face toward the macadam road, ate all of the
plums, broke the pits by using two stones that were
at hand, ate the pits and liked them, then covered
herself with her coat, laid her head on her hat,
and slept.</p>

<p class='c008'>First, however, she said her prayers. She remembered
that she had told lies that afternoon. “I
had to tell them,” she pleaded. None the less, they
were lies, and she dared not sleep with them on her
conscience.</p>

<p class='c008'>When she awoke, it was night, and she was cold.
What awoke her was a train, plunging past her
overhead, with shrieks of its whistle, a roar of
wheels, and a clanking as of many chains.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>She smiled to herself in the dark. What would
the people on the train say if they knew that beneath
them, as they tore along, was a little girl who
was running away? “Some day, when I’m a famous
actress,” she promised herself, “I’ll write all
about this to the newspapers. And then the people
in the train will remember, and be awfully interested.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was strangely unafraid. For one reason,
she felt so secure. In the first place, she must be
many miles from home. They would not think of
searching for her at such a distance. If they did,
who in the world would ever dream (if he were to
pass that bridge) that she was curled up snugly
under one end of it? “I couldn’t have found a better
place,” she declared, pleased with her own judgment.
“Tomorrow night I’ll hunt another bridge
just like this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She tucked her coat more carefully about her,
then composed herself for more sleep. She heard
little noises about her, as if a rabbit were out, or
a badger. She felt that rabbits and badgers would
add a touch to her story—that story she would write
about herself when she was famous. She began to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>word it now. The account merged into something
her father was saying. It was: “She hasn’t gone
past here. I feel sure of that. Let’s take our
time——”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s take time——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe opened her eyes. It was broad daylight.
Another train was passing overhead, shutting out
the sound of the voice. She raised herself a little,
and peered to both sides.</p>

<p class='c008'>What she saw was men—two lines of them!
Each was a little distance away from his nearest
neighbors. All were walking in the same direction—toward
the little town. The train gone, Phœbe
could hear the men calling to one another. She
wondered what it was all about.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she knew! They were hunting her! If
they found her, they would drag her out, all dusty
as she was, and carry her back with them. And
she would be laughed at, and talked about, and
pointed out, as if she were wicked, or crazy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Once she had told herself that she did not care
what the town thought or said. Now she knew that
if she were to return, a culprit, she could not bear
it, could not face anyone again. She had feared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>to face them all—Uncle John in particular—after
her discovery by Mrs. Botts. But now—! This
was a thousand times worse!</p>

<p class='c008'>When Uncle John had told her that her mother
was dead, she had not thought of dying. But now
she longed to die. There flashed across her mind
the picture of herself as they would find her. Perhaps
she would be lying, pale and still, on some
flowery, sunny slope, where, faint from lack of
food and drink, she had at last sunk down. Or,
better still, she would be washed by the waves toward
some shore, and the moon would shine on her
white face, and her hair would float out on the
water.</p>

<p class='c008'>She heard steps. Farther back against the timbers
she crouched, and held her hat before her
face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the voice began again—“Somebody
would’ve seen her, I tell you, if she’d passed.” She
lifted her head, unable to believe her ears. Her
father’s voice! And he was in Peru!</p>

<p class='c008'>Then two men moved into sight from the direction
of the wide road. One was a stranger. The
other was her father. As they halted under the
bridge, Phœbe gave a great cry, and half crawled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>half rolled, from her hiding-place. Her face was
streaked with dirt, her hair tangled, her dress
rumpled. Sobbing, she almost fell down the embankment
to her father’s arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy! Oh, Daddy! Daddy! Oh, Daddy, forgive me!
Forgive——!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He caught her to him, and she knew that he was
weeping, too. Oh, the joy of having his arms about
her, of feeling herself back in his tender care!
Men were running toward them from both directions,
shouting as they came. Shots were being
fired. It was all because she was found. But she
hid her face and clung to heir father. What mattered
if only she had him?</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear baby!” he was saying. “Oh, my precious
little girl! Oh, were they bad to her while Daddy
was away? He’ll never go again—he’ll never leave
his darling again——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He carried her through the crowd that had gathered,
and stepped with her into the tonneau of an
automobile. The car turned slowly. A great cheer
went up. Nearby a church bell began to ring.
Then the ride home began.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe lay as she had lain that afternoon and
evening on the train, her head pillowed on her father’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>shoulder, her feet curled up on the wide seat.
But now her father talked to her, lovingly, soothingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“She wanted to go back to New York, my baby,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,—oh, yes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, she shall! She shall!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Daddy, do you mean it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Darling, I was keeping that as a surprise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She threw her arms about him. She drew herself
up so that she could speak, her lips at his ear.
The man who was driving them—he must not
hear. “Daddy,” she whispered, “just you and I
will go? Nobody else?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was puzzled. “Why—why, who else?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, nobody, Daddy! Thank you! Thank
you!” Contentedly she rested her cheek once more
against his coat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The little apartment is all ready,” he went on;
“and Sally is waiting. And down there not a soul
shall ever know——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She nodded. “About this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not a soul,” he promised. Then to the man,
“Speed up!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>They were nearing town now. The driver fairly
tore past the depot, and along one short street
to the gate of the Blair grounds. The gate was
open, and the car whisked through a little group of
the curious who were waiting. Another group,
with more boldness, was at the front porch. But
the automobile did not stop here. Taking to the
lawn, it circled the house to the rear entrance.
Grandma was there. And Phœbe’s father was out
of the tonneau and up the steps to the kitchen before
anyone could follow them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the rear hall, Phœbe was set upon her feet.
Her father knelt beside her, wiping her face and
smoothing her hair. Grandma joined them, speaking
not at all, but shaking her head very hard.
There were tears on her old cheeks. Grandma did
not look angry—only glad and sad! Phœbe, glancing
at her, knew that in the future there would
never be any blaming on Grandma’s part.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Uncle Bob!—what about him? He was the
Children’s Judge, used to dealing with young
wrong-doers. Mrs. Botts had called Phœbe “a
little sneak”. What would Uncle Bob do to a little
sneak?</p>

<p class='c008'>All nervous and frightened and tired as she was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>there flashed across her brain the picture of herself
up before this dearer of her two uncles—before
him at the very bar of his terrible Court, her head
hanging while scores of strangers stared at her,
and Uncle Bob passed judgment!</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she heard the door open. It was not Sophie—the
step was too slow and too heavy. The door
closed, softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe knew who it was; she held her breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Little old dumpling!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe turned. “Oh, Uncle Bob, I’m sorry—and—and
I’m ashamed!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see both sides of this question,” he said gently.</p>

<p class='c008'>She held out her arms in a wild, tearful appeal.
“Then you won’t arrest me! You won’t take me to
Court!”</p>

<p class='c008'>It brought him to her in a rush. He put his
arms about her, and gave a great gulping laugh,
and hugged her.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Phœbe’s inmost soul there was no real fear
of his punishing her publicly. But the growing
woman in her sensed the dramatic, and enjoyed it.
Also, she knew how to touch the big heart of this
uncle; the heart of her father, too!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!”—Uncle Bob was reproving her lovingly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“Going to the movies isn’t a State’s Prison
offence—not yet!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She felt suddenly weak and faint. Someone put
a glass to her lips—a glass of warm milk. It was
Grandma. She tried to smile as she drank. Grandma
was smiling at her.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the glass was drained, Uncle Bob caught
her up. “No, Jim, let me carry her,” he begged.
(Phœbe felt like a real heroine!)</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment, the thing most dreaded came
to pass. The dining-room door opened. Through
it came Uncle John. “My dear child,” he began.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob halted, Phœbe in his arms. “Not a
word!” he cried, his voice trembling with anger.
“I won’t have Phœbe picked on. If you’re wise,
you’ll stop fighting the movies and fight <i>with</i> them—fight
for better pictures. Don’t tear down—<i>improve</i>!”
Then he went on.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was a happy surprise awaiting Phœbe
when her room was reached. The surprise was
Miss Ruth, with one of Sophie’s big aprons pinned
about her. She received Phœbe from Uncle Bob,
and there was no mistaking her joy. It was Miss
Ruth who tended Phœbe, undressed and bathed her,
helped her to bed, and brought her the broth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>“You won’t go, will you?” whispered Phœbe,
lying back among the pillows. “Please don’t leave
me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wouldn’t think of it,” declared Miss Ruth.
She took a seat beside the bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe sighed, snuggled her cheek against Miss
Ruth’s hand, and slept.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Uncle Bob was exasperated. He was talking to
Phœbe’s father. Phœbe could hear him, from
where she lay on the sofa in Grandma’s bedroom.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A person would think you’re first-cousin to a
mule!” cried Uncle Bob. “What makes you so
stubborn, Jim? Don’t you <i>see</i> what you ought to
do!—Oh, my goodness, the thing is all so simple!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe could hear someone walking, to and fro,
to and fro, across Uncle Bob’s room. Then, “Well,
you see, old man, the trouble is there isn’t anybody,”—and
Phœbe’s father laughed. (What
were they talking about?)</p>

<p class='c008'>“You can’t think of anybody?” scolded Uncle
Bob. “Well, I can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ve got it all fixed up.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The footsteps halted. Again Phœbe’s father
laughed. “You’re a wonder!” he cried. “Well,
your Honor, who is it?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>There was silence for a moment. Phœbe’s
father answered then, but he spoke very gravely.
“No, no,” he said. “I know who you mean. And
that would never do.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What’s the matter with her?” Uncle Bob was
impatient.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nothing,”—calmly. Phœbe heard the scratch
of a match.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You bet your life there’s nothing the matter
with her!” (Who was “her”?)</p>

<p class='c008'>“What makes you think she’d fall in with your
plans, old brother?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“First hand information. She told me that she
cared.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe’s father laughed again, but in a curious
way. “I don’t believe it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s true. I made her confess.” (Confess!
“Are they talking about me?” Phœbe asked herself.)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bob!—But that wasn’t fair! not fair to her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” agreed Uncle Bob, contritely. “But
I did it for the sake of the child.—Oh, Jim, before
you go——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Before I go,” returned Phœbe’s father, quietly,
“I won’t do something unworthy.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>“Unworthy? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Along with the rest, Bob, I happen to know that
<i>you</i> care.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>I?</i>—Say!” Now Uncle Bob laughed. “Who
on earth’s been telling you fish stories?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bob, you’re a wise old bird. But you don’t
fool me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim, you’ve been listening to one of Phœbe’s
moving-picture yarns!” (Phœbe sat up. They <i>did</i>
mean her!)</p>

<p class='c008'>“Judge,” said Phœbe’s father, “I can beat you
at golf.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was then that, suddenly, Uncle Bob seemed
completely to change. He grew more earnest, his
voice rose. “Oh, listen, Jim!” he begged. “I’ve
taken her around a little——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Bob,—no! no! no!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe leaned back, completely at a loss to understand
any of it. Fish stories? Moving-pictures?
Golf? And that “her” again!</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I tell you!” insisted Uncle Bob. “You
ought to have done this fifteen years ago.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that so!” retorted Phœbe’s father, sarcastically.
“Well, fifteen years ago I wouldn’t step in
your way.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“I!” Uncle Bob laughed, but not pleasantly.
“Old, and fat, and bald.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will not do it,” said Phœbe’s father.</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I won’t be a dog in the manger!” Uncle
Bob struck a hard surface with his fist.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bob, <i>please</i> drop it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a nice father!” taunted Uncle Bob.
“You’re a peach! Letting me or anyone else come
before Phœbe.” (“It <i>is</i> about me,” declared
Phœbe. “I’m ‘her,’ after all.”) “My life’s half over,
Jim: Hers is just beginning.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’re a blessed old brother,”—and Phœbe
could tell that her father felt deeply as he spoke,
for his voice shook. “But listen to me, Bob:
When we went tramping, as boys, if I got tired you
always dragged me along by the hand. And how
you always shared everything with me! Well,
you’re my old side partner, and I won’t do this
thing—I won’t!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jim, I’m a poor pill if I can’t practice what I’m
always preaching from the Bench: The child comes
first.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Listen!” insisted Phœbe’s father, gently. “I
had my chance at happiness, Bob, and I made a mess
of it. But—I’ve got Phœbe, and you——”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>“Forget me! I’m out of it. And why should
you cheat yourself? And her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Sh!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe’s father was standing in the door of
Grandma’s room, staring down at the figure on
the sofa. “Have you been here all the time?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mm. Haven’t been asleep, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, do you think you can stand some very
good news?” He came to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh,—not back!—not New York!—<i>oh!</i>” Phœbe
sprang up, holding out both arms. “When?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew her to him. “Tomorrow. So get all
the rest that you can today, little girl. Tomorrow
at this time we’ll be whirling along.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob was watching them. “You mean it?”
he asked Phœbe’s father. “You’re going to leave?
And not say a word?—Oh, it’s all wrong, Jim! It’s
all wrong!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>What was all wrong? What word did Uncle
Bob want Daddy to say? And to whom? In particular,
what was it that Uncle Bob wanted Daddy
to do? And who, oh, who, was “<i>her</i>”?</p>

<p class='c008'>She longed to go down to the kitchen and ask
Sophie. But she knew there was no use—Sophie
would tell her nothing. Just now Sophie was on
her best behavior, and was taking a distinctly
grown-up attitude toward Phœbe. She had come
close to being dismissed. And she had not been independent
about it. For what she had done was,
by the very nature of the case, known throughout
the town, which meant that other families might
not care to hire a girl who had stolen out in the
evening to a theatre, taking with her a child. Uncle
John had pointed this out to Sophie, adding that
he would make it his business to see she did not
deceive any other employer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle John and Sophie had had what Phœbe
guessed was a most exciting interview. Phœbe was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>almost sorry to have missed it. While Uncle Bob
and Phœbe’s father were out and away, searching,
Uncle John had attended to Sophie.</p>

<p class='c008'>Grandma told Phœbe (in a whisper!) that Sophie
had knelt in front of Uncle John, weeping grievously
over Phœbe’s disappearance, blaming herself
bitterly, and pleading for forgiveness. Uncle John
had been sternness itself. At first, he had declared
for one course: Sophie must go. Later, when
Sophie vowed that she would give up moving-pictures,
he had softened a little. Still later, she
brought down to him all the photographs she owned
of “movie” stars—forty-seven in all. She had
thrown them into the fireplace in the library, and
put a match to them. Then Uncle John had relented.</p>

<p class='c008'>So Sophie was being a new Sophie—quiet of
foot and tongue, and quiet of dress. For two days
she had not even curled her hair!</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s no use asking her,” concluded Phœbe,
feeling somewhat injured. That man, too, was responsible
for the blame heaped on Sophie—that
man who had tagged them home from the theatre,
and sat with them twice. Phœbe was angry
with him, too.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>She was still puzzling her head over what Uncle
Bob and her father had to say to each other, when
here came the former—almost stealthily, with
glances over his shoulder. His face was red; his
eyes were solemn. Once inside the door of Grandma’s
room, he locked it!</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s all right,” he whispered. “Grandma
knows.” He came to sit beside the sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a long moment he did not speak. He patted
her shoulder absent-mindedly, and the small hand she
had reached out to him—this dear uncle whom she
was so soon to leave! All the while he looked past
her, out of the window. And his lips, tight-pressed,
worked in the way they had when he was framing
something important.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he finally spoke, it was with great gentleness.
“Of course, I wish you hadn’t gone to that
theatre without permission,” he began. “But I
wish more that you’d been so happy here at home
that even a movie wouldn’t have tempted you. But
you haven’t been happy. You’ve been shut up like
a bird in a cage. No chums, no fun, no school—though
Uncle John has tried to do his best.” He
stroked her cheek.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Phœbe nodded. “He’s talked about my soul,”
she reminded. “But—I guess it hasn’t helped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Another wait, with no patting of her shoulder,
nor stroking of her cheek. Then with a sudden
move he fairly lifted Phœbe from the sofa and held
her at arm’s length. His face—Phœbe had never
before seen it with this expression. It was white
now, and his eyes stared into hers. His lips were
trembling. He breathed like a man who is gathering
himself for a leap.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” he began again, “if Uncle John failed,
it’s because he couldn’t help it. You see, only mothers
understand little souls. Dear old dumpling, let
Uncle Bob tell you what’s wrong! You’ve got just
about everything that any small girl could ask for—good
food, and a roof, and clothes, and relatives,
and a wonderful daddy. But the most important
thing——”</p>

<p class='c008'>She understood. “My mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You’ve been so brave. Oh, Uncle Bob has
watched, and understood how you’ve grieved since
your mother went. She can’t come back to you—you
realize that. And—and wouldn’t it be best if—if
you—that is, certain care and companionship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and love are coming to a girl your size—you need
it, and so——”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was floundering, he was stammering, and he
was getting very red again. Phœbe regarded him
with grave eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What do you mean, Uncle Bob?” she asked
bluntly.</p>

<p class='c008'>He took both her hands in a firm grasp. “I
mean just this:” he answered firmly enough; “you
need a new mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stood up, and drew away from him. “A
step?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“A step.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Daddy has promised that we’re to be alone
together—with Sally.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He nodded. “Suppose he has! How about getting
a step-mother yourself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I don’t <i>want</i> one!” she protested. “I just
want my real mother—like other girls have!”
And then, in a quavering remonstrance against
Fate, and with breast heaving, and clenched fists,
“Oh, <i>why</i> haven’t I my mother! Even the kittens
have a mother, and the little ducks have a mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” cried Uncle Bob, triumphantly, “you’ve
made my point for me, young lady!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“Point? What?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The little ducks have a step-mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“M-m-mm!” That was a new thought. Phœbe
sat down.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That Plymouth Rock,” went on Uncle Bob, “is
a mighty good little hen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never thought,” agreed Phœbe. “Of course
that hen <i>is</i> a step.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Nice, kind little step! You see, my dear, some
step-mothers are bad—like Mrs. Botts. And then
some are just peaches—like Grandma.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe leaned closer. “Grandma?” she repeated.
“You mean——?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Darling, we never told you. At first, for no
reason, except that we boys—your daddy and
Uncle John and I—have never used the word to
each other, much less to anyone else. Afterwards,
when I found you hated step-mothers—when Manila
helped you to think them all bad—we still
didn’t tell you. We wanted you to learn to love
Grandma dearly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do.” (Grandma! She of the gentle look and
gentler voice, who did not know how to be cross
or unkind, she was a step-mother!) “Then of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>course,” she added, “Grandma has never—er—whipped
you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He burst into laughter, throwing back his big
head and slapping his knees. “Whipped!” he repeated.
“Whipped! Oh, Phœbe!” Then, gravely,
“That sweet mother-woman? Why, I couldn’t
love Grandma better if she were my own mother.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You couldn’t?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I never knew the difference,” he declared earnestly.
“She’s been so wonderfully dear. And—you
wouldn’t either, Phœbe. No; very soon, you
wouldn’t either.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wonder,” commented Phœbe. She was thinking
aloud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take your daddy,” went on Uncle Bob. “He
was just a little shaver when Grandma came to us.
He wasn’t strong—he didn’t sleep. She spent night
after night carrying him, mothering him. Grandma
saved your daddy’s life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then Grandma <i>is</i> a good step,” asserted Phœbe.
Her eyes grew moist with quick gratitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There are thousands of good steps,” declared
Uncle Bob.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But Manila—see what Manila got!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>He smiled knowingly, mysteriously. “Manila’s
own fault,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. She made the mistake of not picking her
own step.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Manila’s father picked Mrs. Botts,” confided
Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Mrs. Botts picked him,” contradicted Uncle
Bob. “Oh, Phœbe, I want you to trust me, to believe
me!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course!” she cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,”—he rested a hand on either shoulder—“you
need a good step. But you mustn’t make
Manila’s mistake. You must not trust to your
father’s judgment. You—must—pick—that—step—<i>yourself</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe gasped. “Myself?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yourself—or you won’t get one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but,” she protested, trying to rise from
beneath his hold.</p>

<p class='c008'>He would not let her go. “Phœbe! Oh, Phœbe,
listen to me! Your father guesses that you don’t
want him to marry. And so he won’t. For that
very reason <i>you</i> must choose your mother. And
you must choose her before you go!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>“Before tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This very afternoon!”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that they both rose. There was that set look
about Uncle Bob’s jaw which Phœbe, learning the
moods of men, recognized as a sign of determination.
Before that big, glowing countenance and
those clenched teeth, Phœbe weakened.</p>

<p class='c008'>He saw that. “Oh, Phœbe,” he pleaded, “there’s
so much that you must know for your own safety
and happiness. My little girl, you didn’t even
realize what dangers lay along the Valley Road
as you went! Think of it! It makes my heart
sick when <i>I</i> think of it. Well, there must be someone
beside you—some dear woman who will love
you, someone you can trust and love!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But—but who—?” she faltered.</p>

<p class='c008'>He drew back. “Mm,—yes, that’s so. Now,
who?” He took one of his characteristic turns,
hands behind back, knuckles of one tapping the
palm of the other. “Now who? Of course, it must
be somebody nice.”</p>

<p class='c008'>She stared. “I should think so!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,”—Uncle Bob came about, suave and smiling
once more—“there are any number of charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>ladies about. Now let’s just think. Mm!
Who? For instance.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“We-e-ell.” Phœbe gave him a sidewise look.
Certain “movie” stars (she could think of two
whom she adored!) had loomed first in her mind’s
eye. But considering what had so recently transpired,
<i>could</i> she venture to mention these young
goddesses to Uncle Bob? She felt she could not.
And besides might not her father, if he were to
marry one of them, find her so attractive that his
little daughter——</p>

<p class='c008'>Staunchly she put jealousy out of her heart.
Once Mother had told her that there are different
kinds of love, and one could not subtract from another.
So if Daddy were to care for a new wife, it
did not follow that he would care a whit less for
his daughter. And so Phœbe met the problem at its
nearest point—the drug-store.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s a new young lady down at Fletcher’s,”
she informed Uncle Bob. “And she likes me better
than the one did who has the baby. Because
as soon as my ice-cream soda is gone, she asks me
to have another. Now, wouldn’t she do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob looked dubious. “It can’t be somebody
who will just ‘do’.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And there’s Daddy. You know—in a way—we’ll
have to please him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that she felt more jealous than before; but
she fought it. “Yes,” she answered steadily,
“we’ll have to pick somebody that Daddy likes.—I’ll
think again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Bob was thinking, for he was scratching
his head as he walked. “Let me see,” he mused.
“Let me see.” He gave a quick glance at Phœbe
from under lowered lids.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I can’t seem to remember another good one,”
she announced apologetically.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her uncle halted—abruptly. He brought his two
fists up in front of him. He smiled, showing all
of his teeth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes?” Her eyes were a little fearful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just the one!” He came to sit beside her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who?” She sat very straight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,”—he took her face between his hands;
his kind blue eyes searched hers, shining upon her
with infinite love; “Phœbe, how about Miss Ruth?”</p>

<p class='c008'>She started. “Miss Ruth!” And that moment
a strange thing happened to Phœbe. The forbidding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>step-mother figure which had haunted her so
long—the tall, bony, heavy-shouldered woman
whose arms were like the arms of a gorilla that
Phœbe had once seen at the Zoo in Bronx Park, in
New York; that gray-haired, sullen-eyed, formidable,
silent creature made out of childish imaginings—now
stepped backward, as it were, out of Phœbe’s
brain; and to take the place that was left, there
came forward Ruth Shepard, a tender smile lighting
her eyes and curving her mouth—Ruth Shepard,
with hands outstretched.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe drew a sobbing breath of relief. “She’d
be perfect!” she declared. “She loves me, and I
love her. And—and Daddy——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe,” went on Uncle Bob, “your daddy loves
Miss Ruth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe blinked, trying to understand. “<i>Daddy</i>
loves her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Devotedly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And—you love her.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t count.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe was puzzling something out: “You love
her, and Daddy loves her, and you’re two brothers——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And each wants the other to be happy,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Uncle Bob, as if completing the sentence. “But
you see, Miss Ruth loves your daddy; she’s never
loved anyone else—not since she wore braids down
her back. So that’s how it is, old dumpling. And
you’ll understand why my own brother pulls back,
and says No, and——” His voice broke.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Uncle Bob,” she asked tenderly, “are you <i>sure</i>
you want Daddy to marry Miss Ruth? Because—because
you’re crying.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His eyes were indeed brimming. But through the
tears shone a smile. He caught her to him, laughing
down at her, pressing her head against his
shoulder, pressing his cheek against her cheek. “Of
course I’m crying,” he said, not even trying to keep
his voice even. “Because I know why you asked
what you did. You think—you’re afraid that old
Uncle Bob will be terribly hurt, broken-hearted.
And so your tender, precious thought is for him.
Oh, little Phœbe! My sweet girl!” He choked.
And fell to rocking her back and forth, not being
able to go on.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” she whispered up to him. “That’s
why. Oh, dear Uncle Bob!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Phœbe,”—he set her free, found his
handkerchief, mopped his eyes with it, blew a resounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>blast, and took on a wider smile than
ever—“this is the truth, little woman: I want
Daddy to marry Miss Ruth better than anything
else in the world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe smiled back at him. Only fourteen years
had those gray-blue eyes looked upon the big world,
yet those years had brought Phœbe something of
that age-long wisdom of woman which is called
intuition. And as she looked at Uncle Bob, she
knew that he was, at one and the same time, telling
the whole truth and a great falsehood.</p>

<p class='c008'>She put a hand against his cheek. “Precious
Uncle Bob!” she whispered tremulously. And lowering
her head, hid her face against his breast.
He had freed her from the ugly vision that haunted:
he had given her the promise of love and peace and
joy. He had said he would do anything in the
world to make her happy. Now he was keeping his
word—he was giving up his hope of happiness
in giving up Miss Ruth.</p>

<p class='c008'>“More than anything, Phœbe,” he repeated huskily.</p>

<p class='c008'>She moved her head in assent “Then he will,”
she said simply.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But there isn’t any time to lose!” Uncle Bob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>stood up, wound his watch-chain round a finger,
pulled the big silver time-piece from its pocket,
consulted it hastily, and shoved it back. “I must
get Miss Ruth. I’ll telephone her house.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, but suppose she won’t come,” suggested
Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What shall I say to her?” Uncle Bob looked
suddenly helpless.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know!” A mischievous twinkle came back
into Phœbe’s eyes. “If she holds back you <i>scare</i>
her!”</p>

<p class='c008'>He gasped. “Scare her?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Once I saw it—in the movies,” she confided
excitedly. “Oh, Uncle Bob, you say to her, ‘Poor
Phœbe is dying!’”</p>

<p class='c008'>He joined in her laughter. “You muggins! If
I have to, I’ll do it!” Then gravely, “When she
gets here, go awful slow—take your time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe gave him a wise smile. “At first, I’ll
just hint.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good. And—and there’s something else: If
I were you I wouldn’t tell Miss Ruth that you’ve
talked this over with me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I won’t,” she promised, understanding.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“Let her—and Daddy—think it was all your
idea.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If you think I’d better.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do. And, Phœbe, I’m not going to tell you
what to say, or how to say it; I’m just going to let
you follow your own blessed ideas.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Her eyes grew solemn. “You needn’t be afraid,”
she answered reassuringly. “I know <i>just</i> how to
do it. I’ve got a wonderful plan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, fine!” Then a little awkwardly, “But—er—I
wonder if you could manage (just this once)
to tell a—a sort of a fib.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe laughed. “I guess so.” And added,
roguishly, “If it’s a little one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sobered and leaned down to her, taking her
hands. “It’s important. Even if you don’t understand
why, oh, remember and believe what I
tell you—it’s <i>very</i> important. Phœbe, if Miss Ruth
asks you who wanted you to do this, you must say
it was Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It was Daddy,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c008'>He put a hand under her chin and lifted her
face to his. He was smiling. The tears in his eyes
were tears of joy. “Oh, my little girl,” he said
tenderly, “this is going to make everybody happy.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>She looked up at him, not smiling, and not in
the least deceived. She understood his sacrifice. It
was made for her father, for Miss Ruth, for her.
And that moment, Uncle Bob, ageing, growing
stout, getting bald, was transformed to Phœbe,
through her grateful love, into a figure all knightly
and splendid and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I love you,” she told him.</p>

<p class='c008'>He swept her to him in another embrace. “Good
luck!” he whispered. “Good luck, and God bless
you!”—and was gone.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Phœbe, standing at the center of her own room,
slowly turned herself about, as if taking a farewell
look at the big, old bed—so forbidding when contrasted
with the dainty, bewreathed, ivory-tinted
“twin” in which she had slept beside her mother;
at the low heavy chest of drawers that held water-pitcher
and bowl; at the marble-topped “dresser”,
equally ugly, with its slab of stone like something
out of a cemetery; at the tall, dark doors; the
clothes-closet, that abode of fearful shapes; the
high-backed chairs; and the ancient sofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>And yet she was not saying good-bye to the
room and the familiar objects in it so much as she
was to the life she had led there. A swift change
was coming. But not a change merely from the
big room in the big, lonely house to the dear surroundings
in New York. That transfer was indeed
to be made. But there was more about to happen—a
glorious thing! And it was she, Phœbe Shaw
Blair, who was to bring it to pass!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>She laughed a little, out loud. Then suddenly,
for no reason, she covered her face with both hands,
and kissed her palms as if they were the palms
of another’s hands. “Oh, she <i>must</i> say Yes!” she
cried. “Uncle Bob wants her to!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She was all ready. Her face was rosy after a
quick wash in the bowl. Her hair glistened even
with a hurried brushing. She had on white stockings,
and her newest black pumps, and a fresh
smock-dress that was pale blue.</p>

<p class='c008'>She looked down at herself and laughed again.
Here she was, who had wept and worried at the
mere idea of a step-mother, and had even been
glad that Miss Ruth was rather cool to Daddy—here
she was, actually scheming to get a step-mother,
which step-mother was to be that same Miss
Ruth!</p>

<p class='c008'>She went up to the mirror and looked into it.
“Phœbe!” she whispered. “Oh, you’re such a
<i>funny</i> girl!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She sobered. Her glance had caught her mother’s
photograph. She took it up, holding it in both
hands, close, and speaking to it as if to the living.
“Oh, you won’t mind?” she faltered. “Oh, Mother,
try to tell me that you won’t mind!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>She held the photograph against her. Was she
being faithless to her own mother, in taking a new
one? She turned to an open window, and looked
up.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somewhere in the vast sky was her dear one,
more beautiful now, and always to be beautiful and
young. Uncle John said this was true of all who
died. And even though Uncle John did not like her
mother he could not say that she fared any differently
than all the others who went away. Out of
the great blue was Mother looking down now upon
her little girl? And how? Happily? Or in sorrow?</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe looked at the picture again. There was
a tender smile on the lovely face. The eyes looked
full into her daughter’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I know you don’t mind!” cried Phœbe.
“You don’t mind!” She knelt at the open window.
Great white clouds lay against the blue. Phœbe
understood that her mother was beyond them—farther.
She shut her eyes, praying.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, Mother, thank you!” she whispered. “It
isn’t about Daddy you mind—I know that. But
about me—you believe I won’t love you any less,
ever. Oh, Mother, you’ll see I won’t forget you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>even for Miss Ruth. Don’t let it hurt, will you?
Don’t be a weeny speck jealous. Oh, precious
Mother!”</p>

<p class='c008'>She kissed the picture, and got up, strangely
comforted. There was some pink tissue-paper in
the bottom drawer of the dresser. She took it out
and carefully wrapped the photograph. Then she
opened the clothes-closet and found the suit-case.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lining of the cover was loose at one corner,
and two or three little things were under there,
hidden! A valentine from a boy! Some hair-pins,
picked up now and then, and useful, on occasions,
for trial attempts at putting up her hair. And
there was a picture post-card. A girl had given it
to her—one of Miss Simpson’s girls. Phœbe did
not quite understand the meaning of the picture on
that card. But from the look in the girl’s eyes, from
the curious expression of her mouth, Phœbe had
sensed that the post-card was not nice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now she tore it up, with a smart ripping of the
pasteboard that had not a little resentment in it.
They were so “select”, those Simpson girls! Yes!
But one of them had pictures like this! Well, it
could not stay in the same place with Mother’s
photograph!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>The secret little place cleansed of its evil holding,
Phœbe pressed the pink-wrapped photograph to her
breast, and to her lips; then slipped it under the
loosened lining. For with more understanding
than fourteen may be credited with, Phœbe realized
that any picture of Mother had best be put away,
kept for herself only—not for her father, or for
the dear presence that was to share a new happy
home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“May I go right in?—Phœbe! Oh, Phœbe, I’m
so frightened! Darling,—why—why, you’re much
better!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth had entered with a rush, to find Phœbe
just emerging from the clothes-closet. Miss Ruth
was breathless, and a little pale. Now she dropped
the hat she was carrying, and knelt on the carpet,
and caught Phœbe to her.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, I’m—I’m much better,” declared Phœbe.
She bent to kiss Miss Ruth’s hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth hid her face against Phœbe’s breast.
“I’m so glad! So glad!” she said tenderly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You see,” admitted Phœbe, “I wasn’t truly
sick.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth looked up. “But the Judge said——”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe nodded. “I know. Only I—I’ve just
been pretending.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!” laughed Miss Ruth. Then, suddenly
grave, “Oh, you don’t know how it hurt to have
you missing that day! Oh, Phœbe, I’m so happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>that you’re just pretending!” Then, catching sight
of the pumps, and, next, of the blue smock, “Why,
Phœbe, this dress! Something’s happened!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” declared Phœbe, “not yet. But, Miss
Ruth, get ready! Something’s <i>going</i> to happen!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“To me?” Miss Ruth sat back. Her hair was
rumpled. She looked very young and girlish.</p>

<p class='c008'>“To both of us,” promised Phœbe, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ho—ho!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s something awfully important,” cautioned
Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear me! Well, I think I’d better get up, then,
and be prepared.” Miss Ruth seated herself on
the sofa. “Now! I’m all curiosity. Is there anything
I’m supposed to do?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe thought a moment. “Ye-e-es. Let me
see.—I think you can lean back.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah!” Miss Ruth made herself comfortable
against a cushion. “I like this, because I ran all
the way over.” She smiled at Phœbe provokingly.
“And now what?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now try to look just as pretty as you can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth laughed. “Oh, I’ll do my best,” she
declared.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe shook her head at her. “I’m not joking,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>she said earnestly. “You know you are pretty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, give me a kiss!” cried Miss Ruth, laughing
again, and leaning to catch at the blue smock.</p>

<p class='c008'>But Phœbe backed away. “No,” she said firmly,
“it’s too soon——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Too <i>soon</i>?” Miss Ruth was puzzled.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes. You see this has to be done in a certain
way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Right now, a kiss would be turning everything
upside down.” Phœbe was very much in earnest.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well! Well!” Miss Ruth tried to look properly
impressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Next,” continued Phœbe, “I come close to you,
and I look at you, showing that I love you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe!” Now Miss Ruth caught at Phœbe’s
hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No! Holding hands <i>also</i> comes later.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I see.” Miss Ruth leaned back once more.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course, you’re surprised that I love you——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I’m not!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will be when you hear it all,” threatened
Phœbe. “And right now you ought to drop your
eyes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth looked down. It was as if she understood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>suddenly, what it all meant. Her face grew
grave, and softly pink.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s better,” said Phœbe, admiringly. “So
this is when I reach and take your hand.” She took
Miss Ruth’s hand gently, and held it between both
her own. Once, in a charming picture, she had seen
Mr. Henry Walthall do precisely that. “Miss
Shepard,” she went on, “the first day I met you, I
liked you very much. That was before—Mother—went
away. I was unhappy, and you were so
good to me. You knew how I felt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ah, my dear,” breathed Miss Ruth. She leaned
forward, holding out the other hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wait!” pleaded Phœbe. “Because I’m not done.
Miss Ruth, day after day, for all these months,
I’ve liked you more and more. Now I know that
I love you better than I do my relations.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Phœbe, no!” Miss Ruth stared in amazement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes! Oh, not more than Daddy, because he’s
not a relation. But, Miss Ruth, I love you as much
as I do Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“And I love you,” said Miss Ruth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe dropped to the carpet at Miss Ruth’s knee.
“How much?” she asked. “Oh, think hard before
you say!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“I hardly know how much.” She took Phœbe’s
face between her hands. “But very, very much.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you love me so much that you’d do something
wonderful for me?—something that would
make me the happiest girl in the whole world?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What, darling?” Miss Ruth bent close. Her
look searched Phœbe’s face.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe had meant to go on just as Mr. Henry
Walthall would have gone on—“Miss Shepard,
dear little woman, say Yes to me,” and then add,
“Be my mother, and Daddy’s loving wife!” But
she forgot how Mr. Walthall had knelt and looked,
forgot to be solemn and poised; and completely
out of her thoughts went all that she had planned to
say. Instead she threw her arms about Miss Ruth,
and clung to her wildly. “Oh, you must come with
us!” she cried. “We can’t live without you. Daddy
adores you! And <i>I</i> do! Oh, Miss Ruth, I think
I’ve <i>inherited</i> it!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth gently freed herself from the hold
of the young arms. Then without speaking, she
drew back from Phœbe. “My dear,” she said
quietly, “who told you to say that?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe hesitated. The truth was that Sophie had
put the idea of inheritance into Phœbe’s head.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Once Phœbe had protested to Sophie her great affection
for Miss Ruth. Whereupon Sophie, with
a wise nod, had said, “Sure y’ do. You inherited
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the truth would not do! Uncle Bob had told
Phœbe what to say, and she must obey him. It was
a fib, and it was not a little one. But it would do
much—for herself; for Miss Ruth; last, and most
important, for the dear father, who, long ago, had
put aside his own dreams for the sake of the elder
brother he loved.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe looked straight into Miss Ruth’s eyes.
“Who?” she repeated. “Why, it was Daddy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth caught her close, held her for a long
moment during which neither moved nor spoke,
then pushed back her hair and kissed her. “Phœbe,
dear,” she said, “I want to tell <i>you</i> something.
From the moment I first saw <i>you</i> I loved you, just
as you loved me,—oh, so tenderly! I loved you
because you were you; and then, I loved you for another
reason——”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What?” whispered Phœbe.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Can you keep a secret?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe remembered Uncle Bob. She nodded.
“I’m keeping several,” she declared.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“Phœbe,” said Miss Ruth, speaking very low, “I
loved you because you were <i>his</i> little daughter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Daddy’s?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Your dear, fine Daddy’s!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you’ll be my mother! Oh, Miss Ruth, say
that you will! Say you’ll come! Say Yes! Say
Yes!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My little daughter!” faltered Miss Ruth. She
laid her cheek against Phœbe’s hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was then that Phœbe heard a heavy step—heard
the door close, and the step come toward
them. “Ruth!” said a voice. (Uncle Bob had sent
some one else!)</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth rose, lifting Phœbe with her. The
two stood, arms about each other, waiting. But
Miss Ruth’s look was lowered. Only Phœbe silently
beseeched her father.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dearest,” he said presently,—and he was not
speaking to Phœbe; “I suppose there’s no use fighting
against it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” she answered. “No use.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Because <i>he</i> wants it,” went on Phœbe’s father;
“dear old Bob. He’s the one that’s fixed this up?”
He came a step nearer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Ruth looked up then. “My heart was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>breaking,” she whispered, “at the thought of having
you go.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ruth!” He held out his arms to her, and she
went to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Phœbe scarcely knew what to do. She had never
seen just this situation on the screen. But instinct
told her that it would be best, perhaps, to let Daddy
and Miss Ruth have this moment to themselves.
So Phœbe turned aside, and looked out of a window
at the branches that were close and the clouds that
were far. And valiantly she tried to forget the two
behind her, and hear only the birds.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I want you, Ruth,” her father was saying. “Oh,
I’ve always wanted you!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You do love me!” answered Miss Ruth. “Dear
Jim!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“<i>Tweet-tweet!</i>” added a sparrow outside. He
had his head on one side, precisely, Phœbe thought,
as if he were trying to look in. Oh, the prying little
thing! Phœbe swung one hand at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And Phœbe?” It was Miss Ruth, turning to
speak, so softly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, Mother?” said Phœbe.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
